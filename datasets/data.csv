4000,"It's been 10 years and I've helped make these beautiful kids, but still feel like an outsider.","The first half of my adult life spent trying to fix someone that would ultimately kill herself when I was 22 and she was 19. I gave up sports scholarships, friendships and life experiences hoping I could help her navigate life and find some reason to keep going, from the age of 16 to 22.

I met my wife within 6 months I'd my ex's suicide, 10 years ago. I never recieved any help, as hard as I tried to find some. We were blessed with two kids - a girl who is 6 and a boy who is 1.5. I love them more than anything in the world. Literally anything. We tried to get myself pregnant for months, which ended in 2 miscarriages, and my ovary being removed at the size of a cantaloupe. She got pregnant on the first try both times (I'm a sharpshooter if nothing else in life).1

Both our kids are beautiful and hilarious and intelligent, and I love them so much. But they really prefer her.. it wasn't her idea to start a family, in fact she had a lot of reservations. It was me, after the bombshell that I would probably never have a viable pregnancy.

Well they prefer her... Far and beyond. Who can blame them? She's so much more motherly, where as I'm more fatherly. She is the one they love while I am there as a plan B. 

I just feel so left out and useless. Like, why am I even here? They go to her first for comfort and love. My 6 year old practically despises me, I'm sure. 

Can anybody be relate? It's been 10 years and I've helped make these beautiful kids, but still feel like an outsider.",actuallesbians,1579649005,GhostInAPickleJar,,1,True,2020-01-21
4001,I gave a girl my number at a concert... yikes.," I still can't believe I did something *this stupid* but here goes.

 So today I went to a concert with a friend. Very early on, we noticed this hot girl sitting across the aisle from us.

 She gave us classic gay vibes: short hair, flannel, Doc Martens, and just... looked cool? Obviously my WLW brain kicked in and I couldn't breathe for a few seconds.

 Suddenly, high on a mix of concert adrenaline and WLW adrenaline, I decided to write my name and phone number on a piece of paper and give it to her! What could possibly go wrong?

 Well I kept chickening out and had to follow her out of the seated area just to even consider doing it.

 At that point I think my soul left my body, so I just tapped her on the shoulder, gave her the paper, and said ""You dropped this!"". She reacted the way anyone who had a stranger shove a piece of paper into their hands would react: ""Uh this is not mine...""

 And I was back to reality. I didn't know how to get myself out of that one, so I started backing out saying ""Ah... well, ok... I gotta meet up with-"" and walked away shaking.

 I found some friends and told them this story, almost crying from embarrassment, but in the end we all had a good laugh out of it.

 Obviously, she's not going to text me. But I'm still proud of myself for actually making the first move, even if it made me look like a creepy dumbass.

4003,About to ask my crush out. Someone send help.,"Basically I'm about to ask out one of my co-workers / give her number tomorrow, and I'm hoping to get people's opinions.

But let me start this story a little ways back because 1) I want to give some context and 2) I'm kind of ridiculously both excited and nervous. TLDR at the bottom.

About a year and a half ago, I was at a different job where I somehow managed to develop a crush on a co-worker (yeah, I know). Now, normally I'm pretty good at intuitively figuring out if someone likes women, but with her I must have had blinders on. Or one of those ridiculous dog cones. After a great deal of deliberation, I decided to ask her out for drinks. It was... unbelievably uncomfortable. Any amount of charm I usually had just went somersaulting out the window, and I pretty much had a massive foot shoved down my mouth. She turned me down because, as is tradition, she's straight. She must've been caught off guard too, because the way she turned me down was also incredibly awkward and uncomfortable and the entire hallway instantly became a monsterous amalgamation of anxiety. It was also the first time, I had ever really been turned down like that, so I was absolutely mortified.

Now, other than the fact that I asked our a co-worker, I swear I'm capable of being professional. After hiding my head in the sand for approximately a week, we actually became better friends. No harm no foul.

Except for my confidence that is.

Fast forward to now. I'm at a new job. To give some context, I'm an EMT, so I work with one person in one ambulance  for 24 hours at a time. Once you've been here a while, you also pretty much just have your regular partners, so while you'll see other people around a lot, you don't necessarily get to know other people all that well.

So there's this girl. We'll call her J. I've seen her around station before because we both work the same day. I'm not blind so I definitely thought she was attractive, but I didn't pay anything much mind though, because I don't really form an attraction to people unless I've gotten to know them. One day, though, both our partners call out, and we get partnered together.

Holy shit. We clicked. Or at least I think we really clicked. We raved about the things we have in common, and we laughed about stupid shit that happened throughout the day. I left that day absolutely crazy about her. Of course, I still had that incredibly awkward memory of being turned down fresh in my mind, and I also somehow managed to convince myself that she was straight, because no way in hell would I be that lucky.

I'm partnered with one of my regular partners (and really good friend) the next week, and I told her about my little crush. Here's how the conversation went. You can all kill me later.

Me: So, it turns out I like J.

Friend: That's funny. I know someone else who liked her.

Me: Oh yeah? Who?

Friend: [Male co-worker]. But I had to tell them she doesn't swing that way.

Me (gears turning): What?

Friend: Yeah, she likes women.

Me: *Wait, what?!*

Friend: lol you didn't know.

In my defense, we wear uniforms. I mean, people at this company thought I was straight even though normally I'm practically a 100-footer. I had to tell someone to spread the ""rumor-fact"" that I'm gay because some dude thought I was hitting on him.

Anyway, I'm going to ask her out tomorrow, because I think she likes me, too. Also, why not. I told her about my homebrewing hobby and I also told her I'll be bringing her a fresh bottle tomorrow. I've decided (as of now) to tape a little note with also my number to the neck of the bottle before I give it to her. I figure it'll be low pressure for both of us, especially because I don't think I'm too keen on asking her out in person while we're both working. 

My friends say it's cute and/or romantic, but I need more opinions, because I'm worried it'd be a weird way to give someone my number. (Or super dorky, which might be okay because I am, in fact, a dork).

Someone. Help.

**TLDR** About to ask a co-worker out by taping my number to a bottle of homebrewed beer I'm going to give her. Is this dumb? Am I being dumb? Can I hide my head in a bucket now?",actuallesbians,1579651413,hot-gazpacho-,,1,True,2020-01-21
4004,Finally turning my crush into a platonic friend.,"After a year and a half, I think my crush (let’s call her S) and I are in a place where we can hang out strictly platonically and will do so for the first time for her birthday. 

Little back story as to why she’s just been a crush for a year and a half: 

She’s straight and I 100% respect that and always have but we have the worrrrst tension. I have a massive and comfortable as hell couch but when she stayed over (every weekend all weekend for about 6 months) then sparingly after that, she sleeps in my bed. We cuddled every time she stayed over. She constantly said I have nice hands and would always trace over them. When I was with my ex we got in an argument on our anniversary and she went to vent to her secondary. On that day and through the entire night, S and I had literally what I would consider to be the best date day and night I have ever had. She said she wanted to make sure I still had a great day. She still references it and that was a week or two after we met. I tried to talk to her about all of this because a couple of times I would start talking to a woman while we are out and S would suddenly get super flirty and territorial. 

About a year ago, after a long and busy day of us hanging out with her family, we were going to bed she said I’m a problem for her but would just elaborate by saying “you know why.” The next month I left the city for work for 6 months and started seeing someone else (since ended),  so we had some distance apart. We’ve spent the last 6 months trying to build a platonic friendship and keeping a lot of space between us. Most recently last month we had a night that had a lot of intimate buildup moments but I suggested we just go to sleep because we had been drinking. The next night we were a lot better about keeping all that in check. 

We are hanging out this weekend and again will be keeping our actions in check and will not be staying the night with each other. She’s an incredible person and I‘m excited to have her as a friend.

4013,My GF of 3 months recently started avoiding sex with me,"So, about us ... I'm 25 and have had several GFs. My current GF is 35 and has been with men her whole life up until she met me. I'm the first woman she's ever been attracted to. She pursued me, and we fell in love fast and once I asked her to be my girlfriend we have not spent much time apart. At first, we had sex a lot.  We're both definitely very sexual. She was really nervous in the beginning of our relationship and felt insecure that she wasn't doing things right since I've had girlfriends in the past and I'm her first. (she's actually a natural!) We started using strapons, and when we do use them she enjoys wearing it and I enjoy receiving (however we have switched it up, but she definitely gets off  being the dominant one sexually. Recently though, she never wants to have sex. It makes me feel really bad because we're together so much, and when I try to she usually has an excuse or just doesn't seem interested at all. The confusing thing is that when we do have sex, we both enjoy it immensely, she cums more than I do actually. I think  she's realized she prefers to wear the strapon and be more of the ""dominant"" one but can't accept or wrap her head around what that means. Lesbianism is really new to her. I almost feel like she gets embarrassed thinking about it after. Her lack of sexual desire is really affecting our relationship and my confidence. I don't think she has fully accepted her sexuality. Sex will be really good for the both of us, but then recently she made a weird comment shaming strap ons, even though she originally suggested it. It's as if she enjoys and pleasures herself but then judges herself later. I don't really know what to do. I'm also insecure that I'm not properly seducing her. Is this gender dysphoria?

I went to a summer camp (not of the Pence variety) this past summer and I met one of the most beautiful girls I’ve ever seen there. I know us gay bastards like to get carried away and say that about a lot of women, but honestly. she’s gorgeous, funny, has a cute sort of Southern accent, and is exactly my type. we hung out together with a couple other girls pretty much the entire week, and one night we all pulled our mattresses into one room and slept together.

she was definitely flirting with me, and she even told me she was pan, so I know I wasn’t just imagining things. The problem is that at the time I had a girlfriend, so of course I didn’t take things any further than a little bit of flirting. (We did share a bed when we all slept in one room together that one night, but nothing happened.)

6 months later, my now ex-girlfriend and I have been broken up for several months and I’m horny as hell lmao. I can’t stop thinking about this girl and even though I know I did the right thing by not cheating on my then-girlfriend, I wish circumstances would’ve been different.

She still comments on some of my insta posts and just told me today that she thinks I’m pretty.

4027,"Finally Asked A Girl Out, Got Shot Down but a 10/10 experience.","Today I finally asked a girl out. It was sheer agony getting to this point, but boy was it liberating when it was over and done with.

So, the deal was... I am this girl's boss at work. I pretty much became interested in knowing her after seeing her interview with us.

I almost passed her by as I was rushing to get to work on a Monday morning cause I was running late. She was wearing this pink pantsuit standing outside the office doors focused on her phone. I thought she just got off the wrong floor so I chose to ignore her. She spoke to me and asked if I worked there. I said ""Yeah"" and let her in. I thought she was going to be on the marketing team with her get-up. With that in mind, I thought she would be way out of my league but I hoped hard that she would get hired anyway.

A few days later, my boss informed me someone was starting on my team. The name sounded so familiar though I've never heard it in my life. My boss confirmed it was the girl in the pink suit. I was thrilled and scared at the same time. My team and I were so curious about this girl. Like who wears a PINK pantsuit for a Customer Success interview? Someone interesting that's who.

Not sure if we hit it off but she was super nice. Like SUPER nice. Although guarded for reasons that I now have a smidgen of understanding. She seemed flirty. Liked being in close proximity to certain people. She invited me to lunch within her first week. I agreed thinking she invited a bunch of other people. She did not or at least she thought I did. Obviously, this made me sweat bullets and feel very socially awkward. We had a 1 on 1 lunch thing and I'm the type that's comfortable with social interactions that consists of at least two other people.

She asked me where I was from and things about my family. To make it short, I had family issues at that time and it was not a good conversation, at least in my opinion. I got really anti-social by the minute, but she tried being as friendly and open as possible which was very nice. I felt bad having to put her in that situation though.

Anyway, a couple of days later from that disaster of a lunch thing, she asked if people shot film cameras at work. A coworker answered that we all do. I came back with ""Not me, but if you give me a camera I'll shoot."" New girl comes back with ""Who said that?"" I responded, and she said, ""I have an extra one, you can have it."" Again, she's super nice, like give someone $100 camera nice. I wasn't sure if it was because she was just being friendly or you know cozying it up with the boss (although I wasn't the only boss for the team at the time nor was I upper management).

I felt there was a slight fixation on me, and it got me thinking she was interested. I was still questioning if she was even gay at that point. Signs all pointed to YES, she verbally confirmed being Bi/Queer about 2-3 weeks in. The revelation was most likely because I kept hinting at my gayness and also there was another non-binary bi person who started right after her who I was hitting it off with.

Although filled with hope, I filled my days at work with worry. I was trying to push my feelings aside because I thought workplace relationships were a big NO-NO especially because I was her boss. I realized I work at a start-up and people have relationships with coworkers there as a normal thing. I consulted with our HR person and it was confirmed that there were no workplace relationship type restrictions. Lights were turning GREEN on me and my feelings. 

Little did I know my lack of experience was what was gonna get me. I've had a regrettable 3-year (4 years?) relationship before, but I don't believe I asked my ex out. It just kind of happened. This made me feel very inadequate, insecure, you name it. I just kept catching myself staring at her, with words stuck in my mouth. Every time I felt like bursting out or vomiting that I found her wildly interesting, cute, beautiful. I really wanted to go on a date with her. I was still quite worried asking her out would make her feel awkward or uncomfortable cause I was her boss but I thought it through and reasoned it out with four words. ""We're all adults here.""

Every day bearing my feelings got worse and worse. She kept doing silly things, bursting with energy, making me laugh, and it was all too cute. Like clench your fist tight you might think it would leave a mark on your palms type of cute. My feelings were just overflowing and it became quite obvious I won't be able to keep it together.

I revealed to one of my closer coworker that I've been having trouble asking someone out. I never gave him the person's name or any other detail. Then, I revealed this to my other coworker who I think is my long-standing confidant and enabler.

Finally, I revealed it to the newer non-binary person that I got quite close with quickly due to their personality. The first coworker I revealed my troubles to was known to be quite oblivious to many things and he asked during one of my fits if it's about who he thinks it's about. I said yes. With all three of them plus my best friend's encouragement, I finally put my foot down.

I promised myself and my enablers that I will do it today. No matter what, I will do it. Off script or not. Whatever the answer may be. I will ask her out. And I did. I struggled.

I wanted to do it first thing in the morning cause I was ready and pumped. She comes in a couple of minutes late. Shit. Decided to do it at lunch. The earlier failure still got me and there were people around so I delayed it for a couple more minutes. When I was ready to ask her at lunch, it was time for her afternoon nap on her usual sunlit spot. Damn. That was her favorite part of the day. No go.

Lunchtime passed. Thoughts of me failing miserably again got me disappointed in myself. I spoke with my non-binary friend about my agonizing dilemma and got some much-needed self pep talk. The highs and lows of adrenaline got me all tired so I got a mug of coffee with 2 shots of espresso and my energy and outlook were back up.

I was counting the minutes at the end of the day. She came back from doing something and said the sunset is nice outside. She went to take a photo, I came with. An opportunity presents itself. Nice backdrop, just the two of us there. My dumb ass decides to say NAH, and we walked back to our workspaces.

10 more minutes left. I kept hoping I could not do it just for a few more seconds. She had kitchen duty so she was alone in the kitchen area waiting for dishes and mugs from coworkers so she could run the final dish wash of the day. Finally, bravery kicks in. The setting was okay. It could've been better. It was touch and go for like several minutes. I tried remembering what I wanted to say. I could not. She was about to leave and I was like ""Okay, I'm just going to come out and say it... I've been meaning to ask you out."" I could hear screaming in my head like ""WTF BRO WE AGREED TO SAY NICE THINGS BEFORE GETTING TO IT. THERE WERE SUPPOSED TO BE MORE BEATING AROUND THE BUSH. DA HELL?"" Adrenaline pumping made that whole thing quite unintelligible until hindsight kicked in wayyy after. 

She smiled and looked at me with a dumbfounded/confused look and said ""And?..."" I did my signature, iunnomanshit look and hereyouare shrug. She responds with ""I'm actually/currently going out with someone. If it doesn't work out, I'll let you know. We good?"" I respond ""Yeah, we good.""

It wasn't what I was expecting but TRIAL of a lifetime OVER. I honestly did not feel negative at all. I wholeheartedly accepted the entire thing. The main thing I thought was ""She probably just said that to let me down easy as I'm her boss."" then I remember the first thing she ever admitted to me. She doesn't bullshit, she says how she feels. Now I'm having to do a double-take on my thoughts.

Really feeling like I got a chance, as she would actually consider me if her current relationship turns side-ways. I don't think it will, but then again I've been wrong before.

Overall, a rollercoaster ride that left me with a positive taste. Being honest and just doing it made me feel much lighter and freer. It's actually pretty amazing no matter the outcome. I do have a feeling it's cause she's had experience turning people down properly so I might revisit this thought later on.

4028,I’m a useless lesbian who keeps buying Apple products to try to talk to a girl,"So if you’re looking for a laugh, well, you’re here. It’s a long story, so brace yourself.

Backstory, I had a very very old iPhone which needed to be upgraded. I went to my local Apple to exchange my phone, and was helped by a gorgeous girl. I was struck, like sputtering bottom struck. Long story short, we had to download so much software on my old phone that we were talking for an hour and a half. We had similar interests, had a great conversation, and she was so so patient on a busy Sunday before Christmas. At the time, I wasn’t available (I was trying to hold on to a relationship that was on its last legs), so I didn’t even let myself think about getting her number. I blew it and I didn’t know it. 

Well fast forward not too long later, and I’m single, and I’ve been thinking about this girl. So, I try to go to the Apple store again, to get her number.

First attempt, I walk in to buy an Apple Watch charger. I see her, and because I’ve been out of the game and without confidence, I buy the charger off another person. Then I flee. 

Second time...it’s the worst. I saw she was busy with a customer, so I made myself busy by just casually shopping at the store across (which happens to be my favorite store). When I was done, she was still held up. I decided to just casually shop at Victoria's Secret (because I thought the bag would be a good prop). I shopped and got on line. Unfortunately, I was stuck behind at least five people who wanted to complain or exchange things. I was stuck there forever. I finally get a chance to go back to Apple to see if she's free. She’s not there, and a lovely man who uses a wheelchair came up to me asking for assistance. I panicked and in both eagerness to find her, and mortified that I would appear to be disappointed at the man, I agreed, and bought an Apple Watch band that I don’t need. I think I missed her...

Sorry for the long story, I hope it made you laugh as hard as my friends did.

My ex, of almost three years, and I have been in a complicated situation in our relationship for over a year and now finally decided to split due to personal reasons. I haven't had a chance to process things properly yet and I might have been sulking in the sadness brought by the break-up. This morning, she sent me this [message](https://imgur.com/a/gQHRQvX) and reminded me that what we had was precious and is worth treasuring for life.

4043,Queer Spirituality Research Study- Do spirituality and religiosity affect rates of depression and substance abuse in sexual minorities?,"Hey all! I hope that this is appropriate for this group. If not, please let me know and I will remove the post. 

I am a gay PhD student conducting a research study investigating spirituality and mental health in LGBT people. I am conducting a research study looking at the effects of spiritual and religious beliefs on the mental health of people who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, or pansexual.

Talking about religion and sexuality can be a touchy topic for many people. Many same-sex attracted people struggle to navigate often conflicting spiritual and sexual identities. Navigating conflicting identities can often lead to increases in such problems as depression and substance abuse.

There is limited research, however, studying the differences potential differences between affirming and non-affirming religious or spiritual beliefs and how these differences may affect the mental health of people who are attracted to the same gender.

**If you are an adult who identifies as lesbian, gay, bisexual, or pansexual and are currently living in the United States, you are invited to participate in this study investigating queer spirituality and its effect on mental health. Participation is completely anonymous, will take less than 30 minutes to complete, and you can choose to be entered into a drawing for one of three $20 Amazon gift cards.**

I knew I returned the feelings but I was scared. For the past month and a half or so we’ve been hanging out, hooking up, and going on dates. We say how much we like each other every day. She makes me feel so valued and appreciated. And now to the bad part. I’m bipolar. I’ve been in a bad depressive episodes. My days have been so dark gray for awhile now but she makes them lighter. I by no means and relying on her for that or am dependent on that or anything but it’s just nice. Tonight I think I over shared. I think maybe I overwhelmed her with my thoughts. We talked about it and she said she just wants to talk and know how she can help me. I still feel like she’s acting weird. I don’t want to ruin this.

4060,why are we still gatekeeping it’s 20-fucking-20,"When I first came to reddit with my newfound bisexuality, I was met with SO much support from all kinds of people—trans women, gold star lesbians, partners of bisexual women, etc etc.

What the fuck happened?

I’m so tired of getting shit on for being a bisexual in a hetero relationship. Yes it’s not a perfect relationship, I have BPD so it’s not like it ever could be with me, but shit. I literally get asked all the time why I’m here (and on other wlw oriented subreddits). As if being in a relationship with someone changes who you are as a person. I don’t even know what to sarcastically apologize for. 

Seeing posts of people shitting on other wlw in hetero relationships more and more is really starting to wear on me. I literally try so hard to be thoughtful with every word I say to people. Why is it so hard to return the favor? It’s 2020, why are we still judging other people for their relationships, gatekeeping, and policing people’s personal lives?!?! I don’t fucking get it. I am sorry for whatever bad experience you may have had in the past that’s shaped your view of bisexual women in hetero relationships, but that doesn’t mean you get to quantify my “gayness.” This isn’t just about me, I see posts making fun of late bloomer women ALL THE TIME now, here and on other subs. Seriously? Aren’t we better than that??

If you want to gatekeep, fine, but don’t sit there and whine about why so many unicorn hunters are on Tinder when you could get yourself a fucking woman by literally not being a jerk and having an open fucking mind.

4064,mixed feelings about weight loss,"(tw for weight talk and body image; no specific numbers)

so i've never been overweight but i was always on the higher end of a ""normal"" bmi, for what it's worth. i had my insecurities but they were never crippling.

fast forward to four months ago, to when i had some massive life changes.

-i went from pescatarian to vegan (for environmental reasons, nothing to do with weight)

-moved out of my childhood home and started cooking for myself

-moved to another continent (after an *extremely* stressful process)

-started university after a gap year

-moved to a less central location than in my hometown meaning i walk a lot more and cycle

-got taken off medication that listed weight gain  as a side effect

-started ballet again after eight years

because of this, and generally because i guess i seem to finally be over puberty, i have lost a substantial amount of weight. i didn't really notice at first because of how busy i have been, plus i don't have a full body mirror or scale at home. it wasn't until i went back to my home country for the holidays that i understood how drastic the change was. everybody was commenting on my body, and how much better (""healthier"") i look. one day i looked in the mirror and it hit me that yeah, my body looks good (not that it didn't feel good before), but it looks _different_. not bad, just _different_. i feel good in my body; i feel agile, energetic, grateful and pretty. i have been struggling with feeling _sexy_, though, as my hips have gotten smaller so my hourglass figure is less pronounced.

i have noticed people finding me more ""conventionally attractive"", and i can't help but feel pressure to keep the weight off. i have been completely turned into intuitive eating; i like to honor my body by nourishing it and eating foods that make me feel good. i eat balanced and my bloodwork's fine (and my micros+macros are being met, no worries). but i feel like my hard work rejecting the diet mentality is being undone by other people's perception of me. i had stopped feeling guilt for eating ""unhealthy"" foods; and _because_ they weren't off limits, i felt less inclined to binge (it's not just the chocolate that tastes good, it's knowing it's forbidden). but now i am starting to feel that little voice in your head telling me to skip those chips or that serving of ice cream, which makes me want them more. by this, however, i don't want to imply i am falling into disorderly patterns.

i also went clothes shopping recently, after trying on what used to be a form fitting top and my skinny jeans and being hit with the realization that they don't fit anymore (or rather, at the moment). all of my looser, flowy clothes fit though, which is the majority of my closet anyway. i finally decided that it was time. i thought ""well, what if i gain the weight back?"" to which i had to reply to myself with ""what if i don't? and if i do, do i not deserve to wear clothes that fit? do i not deserve to be kind to myself and feel good in my skin in the meantime?"". it was a very unusual experience having to remind myself of my new size. i feel good in my new outfits, i'm just getting used to everything.

weight loss is so often framed as the best, as a cure to your insecurities, as the first step into your glow-up, so i feel strange complaining to my friends because i'm afraid of sounding like i'm fishing for compliments. i guess i just needed to vent a bit. please do share if you've been through something similar; i'd love to hear your insight!",actuallesbians,1579685300,atleastcinco,,1,True,2020-01-22

4069,going through my first girl heartbreak... ouch,"we weren’t even seeing each other for a long time, 2 months? almost 3? but jesus no one has ever made me feel this way before. all it took was me looking at her eyes to know i was in big trouble. 

we are polar opposites, im quiet, introverted, thoughtful, not as trusting and keeps my circles small, a lot of trauma and a cocktail of MH stuff. she’s travelled the world, makes friends with everyone she meets, is opinionated, argumentative, and strong. it was never going to end well. she made me feel like the least interesting person in the world i couldn’t understand why anyone like her would be interested in me but she said she loved me and i felt it. 
i couldn’t get enough of her, I felt like I was on fire every time we spent time together and i never wanted to leave the warm safe bubble we were in. she would sing to me, told her friends and parents about me, referred to me as her girlfriend to people in her work. gave me a really thoughtful xmas present, would get giddy talking about marrying me and having children with me the whole lot. i don’t think ill ever forget how she would look at me.  i asked her out because i thought that’s what she wanted, she told me that’s what she wanted but within days she did a complete 180 on me, she went distant, stopped telling me she loved me, seemed like seeing me was more effort than fun so i asked her what’s going on and she told me she no longer knows what she wants because she’s used to being on her own and there’s still stuff she wants to do before settling. i couldn’t believe it she was telling her friends i was the perfect girl not even a day or two before. 
I gave her space for a week but we fell back into contact after her nan had died, she told me she missed me, needed to talk to me like we used to and that she was so grateful and lucky to have me. I felt special again, I had hope again. Until last night, she told me she’s speaking to her ex again (one that got away situation) and that she’s enjoying her and she’s sorry if that upsets me but it’s not like she expected this to happened. So I blocked her. I can’t do this. I can’t watch her get back with an ex when she made me feel the way she did, when she was telling me she was so in love with me and wanted to marry me barely month ago. I feel empty without her. I miss, love and hate her all at the same time. I feel so stupid for believing what she said to me. I feel like I’ve been played and I can’t wrap my head around why she would do this to me when she knew I thought the absolute world of her.

I'm far from butch, although I'm not extremely feminine either, and I don't play sports or do any other stereotypically ""lesbian"" things. The friend I was talking to commented on this, saying an outsider looking at me wouldn't assume I was gay like they might assume our other friend was.

4094,Toddler's realization she has two moms,"So the wife and I have a two and a half year old and two weeks ago her friend at daycare had the realization that our kid has two moms and no daddy. Cue him asking his mom (cause you need a mommy and a daddy to make a baby) and getting a sanitized crash course that his mom later texted me so we could both have a good laugh.

She broke it down to ""\[kid\] has two mommies and no daddy cause \[kid\]'s mommies wanted a baby really badly so a friend gave them special baby juice to make \[kid\]"" He's three, the answer worked for him and he went off to share his newfound knowledge and be a dinosaur.

Since then our tot keeps randomly piping up with ""Two mommies!"" or ""I have two mommies!"" and we'll just nod and go ""yes you do""

Except now the way she's saying it has changed from learning something new to straight up boasting.

4100,Time to start questioning my sexuality again...,"Ugh, I thought I'd finally managed to find a label but apparently not. See, for the past year, I've basically thought of myself as a homoromantic bisexual, essentially I find girls and guys hot, but I really only see myself in a serious relationship with a woman. Pretty straight forward, and seemed pretty accurate.

At least until last night, when my mom did one of her homophobic lectures, which ended with one of her usual check-ins to ensure I was still ""straight"".

She asked if I wanted to date ladies (I said no, as my inner lesbian shook her head), she asked why (I said because I like guys, which is to say that I don't hate them or anything).

The real stumper was when she asked *why* I like guys. I told her because they have abs (it was at this moment my mind brought up photos of Brie Larson when she was training for Captain Marvel) and because they have stubble (I find stubble to look better than no stubble, but I wouldn't kiss someone with it for fear of rugburn on my face).

Anyway, now I'm confused again. Am I really bisexual or just a lesbian with the ability to pick men who are physically attractive? This is more of a rhetorical question because I doubt anyone of you will be able to just tell me (that would way too easy).

Then she goes, ""Come on, you've been very quiet.""

And I went, ""What do you mean? There's nothing wrong.""

Mind you, I was feeling a bit down today and still is because my boss was basically providing unfair treatment to me, and I just felt as if I'm always being singled out. Like whatever I do at work, it's never enough. So I wasn't in the mood to talk to anyone.

I usually go and ask my crush if she wants to have lunch with me so maybe that's why she thought something was up?

Anyway, later today, I texted her apologising for not being able to help her with this audit she had to do at work. And she replied 30 minutes later saying, ""It's fine!!! You were busy!""

And then the convo sort of felt dry afterwards and I feel as if maybe I've offended her or something?

But then I thought, I wasn't having a good day. And she knows that I was upset the other day because of what happened with my boss and I. So I felt as if, maybe she should've been more understanding of how I was feeling?

But on another note, I also thought, maybe her asking if I was alright was her checking up on me and I sort of brushed her off? But I usually do, especially when I'm upset because I feel like I'm always a burden and no one really cares.

4120,Too nervous,"So...

I've been reading alot of nsfw textposts and smut fanficitons, as well as people just talking, about eating a girl out. Me and my girlfriend make jokes all the time about it, and lately I've been thinking I want to try to go down on her. I was really reluctant the first time I actually fingered her and now it's actually pretty fun ;) but I am constantly worried that I will eventually hurt her or end up giving her an infection because I chew my nails *constantly* and often end up making the skin around my nails bleed, so I have this impending worry that my bloody fingers will infect her insides. The other thing I worry about is that I'll be repulsed by her taste. I have ***never ever*** eaten a girl out or even had sex in general before meeting her. We always make sure we're both on the same page as far as consent and she's so patient and loving to me. I swear one day I'll marry this girl. I have really bad anxiety, both social and general, and I'm always terrified of hurting her. Idk if this is a vent or a question but I just don't know where to go from here. I haven't told her that I'm posting this or that I've been considering this, though she knows I worry that I'll hurt her because of my legitimate bloody fingers (obviously they aren't bleeding when we're getting it on). She's constantly telling me to stop chewing my fingertips, and I really appreciate it, but it's a terrible habit that I want to, but can't, break. I think I'm also a bit of a germophobe because the first few times we did it, I ran to the bathroom and quickly washed my hands. Now I'm chill about all that, but I'm worried that I'll try something and panic again. Plus, idk how girls taste but I know I ended up being the fuckboi I am and licking my finger and it was salty as hell, man.

P.S. what's with the pineapple juice jokes? Like what does that do??

4122,dating &amp; emotional support,"I posted this in another group specific to mental health but, for whatever reason, it feels important to ask for queer specific advice. As a lesbian, dating has always felt really hard to impossible to me. When I talk to my friends who primarily date men, I get really resentful - I feel like it’s so much easier to find partners and whatnot. I’m definitely not with my partner out of austerity, but something about straight / mostly straight peoples advice on dating gives me a bad taste.  I feel a particular investment in making queer relationships work, even when there are problems. It’s hard out there! Anyway, feel free to take this down if it’s inappropriate. 


Recently, I have been experiencing an episode of major depression. I know myself and my symptoms very well, and I have been pretty proactive about taking care of myself. Regardless, the RX and therapy and yoga and light box and omega 3 fish oil have not completely leveled me out. I am still walking around feeling like I have no worth or virtue.

My partner has disclosed feeling very frustrated by me over these past few weeks. The things she is frustrated with - my difficulty getting out of bed, using her for comfort, a lack of interest in her interests - are all textbook symptoms of depression. I have depression, anxiety, and ADHD and have always been extremely open about this aspect of my life. Mental health issues are extremely prominent in my family, I work full time with people with severe and persistent mental illness. I used to be active with the Icarus Project and have done map mapping - articulating what I think I will need when I have episodes during moments of stability. I have previously had conversations about my need to be able to trust her to set her own boundaries regarding how much she can support me - otherwise, I freak out about whether or not I am “too much.”  I was upset to learn that she’s been holding things back because she doesn’t want to hurt me. 

She has particularly  vocalized wanting to spend less time with me because she feels like I’m being clingy and using her as a comfort object. Ive noticed her seeming less and less interested in me - she hasn’t verbalized what she likes about me in a bit, and I’ve been feeling bad about myself when I’m with her. I have been trying to push this all out of my head and consider these negative thoughts - symptomatic of this episode - and so this confirmation of my fears feels like a nightmare. It’s like a self fulfilling prophecy.

We have historically had a healthy relationship, and she is a good person. I worry that she gets overwhelmed by my mental health stuff. I also worry that she flat out doesn’t want to deal with it. It isn’t fun. I get it. I want to move forward and I have apologized. That said, I’m upset and a bit angry. This is my biochemistry. I feel like it should be okay to turn to a partner to provide emotional support when you are struggling. I also feel like she should be doing the work to learn how to date a person with mental illness. There is plenty of stuff out there. I know she cares about me, but I’m doubting how much of a priority I am to her. And then I am doubting my doubts. 

What is realistic? Is it realistic to ask somebody you are dating to hold you while you cry? To read a book about depression?

How do you ask for support while respecting other people’s boundaries? How do you ask other people to set boundaries? How do you move past the belief that you aren’t worth it to your partner - even if that may actually be true?",actuallesbians,1579733763,redditreddit666,,1,True,2020-01-22

4127,Advice - kissing/intimacy problems in first not super short relationship,"Hi all. I feel silly posting this but it's just like, a lot to discuss with someone in real life so here I am. Using a throwaway because embarrassing.

I'm a lesbian in my early/verging on mid 20s and I'm in my first not super brief relationship. I've dated two people properly before, one lasted just a couple of months and one was slightly longer but long distance with not much ability to see each other, so the below problem just didn't have as much chance to come up.

My girlfriend and first started seeing each other about 6-7 months ago, but she's a Masters student so often went home for long stretches of time so even though technically it has been that long, it hasn't been that long of like, actually seeing each other week to week. She's really sweet, kind and funny (and cute) and I like her a lot, the first time we went out even though we hadn't met before we talked for hours and hours.

We've kissed many times but just as a peck here and there, and whenever we try and do more I feel like we both just freeze up and don't do it right. We're both quite anxious people which plays into it I think. Most people wouldn't guess that I have a pretty bad anxiety disorder from just talking to me (I somehow accidentally convinced her best friend that I'm a super confident extrovert, ha) but it definitely does play into things and make things harder for me sometimes.

Tonight we were watching a movie and I had the thought in my mind earlier in the day that I needed to do it or she was going to lose interest in me, but then I had just a really long and rough day with some crappy news at the end of it, so wasn't really in the right frame of mind I think (although I've struggled plenty in the right frame too to be fair.) There was a point where she went to kiss me and tried to do more and I tried to go with it but it just didn't work, it felt like everything was in the wrong place and even though I know the *theory* I couldn't figure out how to do it in practice, it was just like, an awkward lip smooshing mess. 

We pulled apart and she apologised and said she was bad at this stuff and awkward, I told her not to worry and so was I. We talked about her feeling like she's quite a slow moving person, which I said works for me because I am too. (it takes a lot for me to feel comfortable with someone). We ended up having a nice conversation in which I said we should just take things as they work for us and not how they work for other people, which I'm pleased about because yeah, we are slower moving than other people but I'm also just not comfortable kissing someone right away as silly as that might sound. We just cuddled for the last few minutes before she had to go home.

But I do want to kiss her, and I like her. I keep getting freaked out because a lot of people say with things like this if you have this kind of situation, you're not seeing the right people / just don't have chemistry. I don't think this is true, and I'm not in a tremendous rush but I think it's something we both want to do but are struggling with, as ridiculous as that may sound to some people.

I know this is a long post, but I had to get it out somehow, and it's just a lot to talk to about to someone who knows her and I honestly.

Has anyone dealt with a similar situation and/or have any advice? I don't want to rush and push her or myself, but I want to find a way to move past this, even if it is a process.

TL/DR: gf and I freeze up every time we try to do more than peck on the lips. We both like each other, but are easily anxious people who move slower than most. What's a good way to slowly start to move past this and get myself and her to feel more comfortable?",actuallesbians,1579735482,DumbGay_ThrowAway,,1,True,2020-01-22

met her at uni in september and got super close, we would make out when we got drunk and cuddle in bed n she'd sit n play with my hair, but we'd insist it was platonic lol, then she asked me out in the last week of uni in december and we both admitted we had feelings when we were extremely drunk woops, but then we went on a date and i kissed her sober for the first time after we watched mamma mia together

and when we said bye at the bus station i kissed her goodbye and it gave me butterflies being able to express my affection for her like that idk! ah i'm so excited to go back to uni for this to continue developing!

But a few months ago, I went on a couple of dates with a girl who's slightly older than me, and she wore a silver ring on her right fore finger. She told me it was a ""gay thing"" when I asked about it. And today, I saw a picture of her ex-girlfriend (the girl she dated before me) on her Instagram story. I spotted that her ex-girlfriend was wearing a silver ring on her left fore finger. 

Now, I'm wondering if wearing a silver ring (or any other ring) on your fore finger is a thing that queer girls do. Or is it just a piece of accessory they both uniquely wore to signify their bond?

I'm also thinking of getting one for myself if it really could subtly imply that I'm a lesbian.

This was the opening of my mother's response:

""I am glad to hear that you are well. The way you have not looked after yourself for many years has always been a source of concern and it is good to know you are now healthier. 

I am not sure what to say to the rest of your email. I do not want to fight or debate with you, but I feel that you hope and believe; although I may be wrong; that given enough information, enough time and the chance to rethink our ‘religious beliefs’ we will, at last, see that we were mistaken and come round to your thinking. Knowing that you are happy and healthy will be what matters and we will be able to let go of outdated ideas. Unfortunately that hope presents a great many problems and I feel I need to explain to you why that is.""

4190,Trans lesbian thoughts,"Hopefully, this won't get too vent-y or depressing, and some parts will probably seem stupid due to this subreddits very reason for existing, but something I've found as a trans lesbian browsing this subreddit is that sometimes cute, wholesome, posts/memes celebrating lesbianism can kind of have an adverse effect on me.

This isn't to say that these posts are in any way bad (far from it), but the fear that you won't have a fulfilling, long term relationship with a girl because you're trans is one that's all too common among trans people. In my case, I get the feeling that any relationship I do have won't be fulfilling to my partner. Like if she or I say ""this is my girlfriend, we're lesbians"", will have a MASSIVE unspoken asterisk next to ""lesbians"", and this massive asterisk will be present any time I partake in *lesbicious activities.*

Basically, at worst I'm afraid that no girl I date will ever *really* think of me as a girl and that they'd be much happier with a ""real"" girl, and so I kind of project this outwards at posts celebrating lesbianism. When I see a wholesome meme about how pretty girls are or gushing about sword lesbians, I think ""they're not really talking about trans lesbians, and if they are, it's with a massive asterisk"".

This is very much a 'me problem', internalized transphobia is something I struggle with a lot (I can thank the online anti-feminist communities that I spent my early teens in for that), and I recognize that it's kinda stupid for me to look at posts in r/actuallesbians and think ""well they're probably transphobic"".

4202,Back pain after face sitting?,"Does anyone experience sharp back pain after someone else sits on your face? I couldn't straighten my back or breathe normally afterwards because I felt stabbing pain radiating out from my spine; I could only take shallow breaths without pain. Sitting hunched over was easier, but rolling my shoulders back into a slight arched position (sitting) made it much, much worse. The pain dissipated after 20 minutes / half hour or so, so clearly not an injury. What the heck is going on? Is this because my neck was at a funny angle? Is it a weight distribution problem? Does it point to underlying health issues that I should be concerned about? Any insight about the cause, how to avoid in future, or just commiseration so I know I'm not a weirdo is very welcome.

4212,DAE feel like their looks don't match their personality?,"Long-ish post! I'm just using ""type"" to describe a particular style.

Okay, so, I tend to be romantically attracted to a certain ""type"" of girl. A surprising amount of times, they find themselves attracted to me. But they all seem to have fundamental personality differences from me that eventually cause them to lose interest. They seem to like my personality for a while, whether we just text, video chat, hang out in person, become something that's not official, or become something that IS official. 

I'm not super attractive, and people tend to describe me as quirky and sweet. And I feel like once the novelty of my ""quirkiness"" dies down, my personality isn't enough since we're just so different. I know it can be a combination of factors, and it probably is...

I tried to find people I am mildly aesthetically attracted to that are more like me vibe-wise, but we've only ended up having small chats, becoming friends (with them being in a relationship already), or becoming friends that are just not into each other romantically.

So I think I'm struggling because people expect something different when they see me... Like I seem to attract girls that are aesthetically my ""type"" but personality-wise are totally incompatible with me.

I don't plan on changing how I look because of this, lol. And I'm just enjoying being single for a while until I meet more people like me/have the energy to seek something out. I was just wondering if anyone else has a similar problem or a perspective that I'm just not seeing...

4213,Please help: Falling in love with a friend,"I’ve been in denial for months, recently had a falling out with a friend and realized that my love for them is more than just platonic (which I have played it off to be to them).

We started getting close last year. I came out this summer and since then things have felt off. It seems like we are never on the same page and are constantly disconnecting, then try to reconnect just to disconnect again. 

When I met her 3 years ago it was love at first sight (before coming to terms with being Bi). It was at a party, I was immediately drawn to her and wished to know her. I thought that I would never see her again but soon after she popped up in a different close setting in my life. From there we slowly got to know each other and got really close over the last year. 

I’m in love with this girl in a way I’ve never loved anyone in my life. Even past romantic interests. 

Recently during one of our falling outs, someone who know’s both of us well suggested that maybe she was “in love” with me. Ever since then, I can’t get the idea out of my head. We don’t talk much about sexuality but for all I know/assume she is straight, though even before coming out I felt a possible sense. But when that point was brought up its made me think about some things that I’ve thought were odd...

- asking to hold my hand while talking about resolving things 
- saying she built a wall because of a time she hurt my feelings in the summer (which I had thought we had worked out) because she thought she broke us 
- said she had a dream where I didn’t want to be her friend anymore and said that she woke up very stressed and upset because she couldn’t imagine that 
- when I was crushing on a girl, I made a comment to her and our other friend that when I was with that girl it was was like nothing else mattered and I could spend all my time with her. She got upset by that comment, while my other friend with a Boyfriend understood.
- acts very opposite of my other friends when I pursue romantic partners, doesn’t ask questions or bring it up 
- one time we did yoga together and after I was so relaxed and quiet and started going to my car and she was like “can I give you a hug?” which is very unlike her
- she hasn’t really dated anyone since HS and when I encourage her she plays it off. I know she’s had a crush on a guy and I encourage her to ask him out but she just pushes it away. 

It feels like we both feel very deeply for each other and if we were just honest with each other this wouldn’t be happening? Or maybe we were just in the friendship honeymoon stage? 

I’m very broken over this and I am not sure what to do. I want things to feel normal again or create a new normal instead of feeling in this weird space.",actuallesbians,1579788381,agutie1002,,1,True,2020-01-23

4220,"Seeking advice from non-closeted lesbians on coming out, when I'm in a relationship with a man","Hi! I'm on a throwaway account bc my bf knows my other reddit.

So I went to a super lesbophobic all girls school and left very repressed, with no friends, low self esteem and pining for male attention. From college to university I slept with around 60 men. I found myself attracted to effiminate men, and my attraction would wane after a couple sexual encounters. Looking back I recognise that it was probably the thrill of new romance moreso than anything else. I have kissed a few girls, mostly straight girls though, and the few times when an actual lesbian would come onto me I would kinda freak out and hide.

3 years ago, I met my current boyfriend. I live with him now. We don't really have sex anymore, I just don't feel sexual attraction to him, it feels platonic. I find myself crushing on girls, I recently have Very Gay dreams, and I love browsing this sub and r/lesbianfashionadvice. I don't like penises, I've never enjoyed porn that includes men, and a couple years back I decided I'd never give a blowjob again. I currently ID as Bi but tbh as I get older I am starting to feel that I might just be a lesbian.

I know I need to break up with my boyfriend but it's super hard. I worry that if I dumped my boyfriend I'd end up on Tinder looking for another long haired man slightly effiminate man that I'd hope to be attracted to. I don't know how to make this transition, I don't know how to meet lesbians, talk to lesbians, let alone have sex with them. I can just imagine myself getting into the bedroom with a girl and just freaking out.

Would really appreciate any advice and encouragement from you all. I'm feeling very lost, confused and depressed about my sexuality.",actuallesbians,1579789986,plantgirl64,,1,True,2020-01-23

4235,Gf invites her sister on our dates without asking me first,"My gf (26) and I (27) have been together for about a year. My gf lives with her sister. 

This thing happened yesterday that has happened enough already for me to be annoyed.

I asked my gf in the morning if she wanted to get dinner and coffee after work. She said she’d love to go. 

Then about a couple of hours before she and I were supposed to go, I asked her if she wanted to get tea instead (wasn’t in mood for coffee) and she said she already told her sister about coffee though and her sister was looking forward to it.

I was just like...uh what? 

She does this fairly frequently. I ask her out and she invites her sister without asking me first if that’s okay (I think because they live together and she feels guilty if we go out and her sister is at home. But her sister is also 28...).

Her sister also just stresses me out in general because I feel like whatever I talk about in her company, she repeats to their mom. So it adds layers of pressure when she joins us. 

I’m okay with hanging with her, just not interested in inviting her on MOST of my dates with my gf. Like a few of our hangouts, no worries. I do want to have a friendship with her. But most dates? 😳

4237,Lesbian happily after turned to a lesbian’s worst nightmare,"Lately everything has been extremely painful for me, just one of the most difficult obstacles for me to overcome. I met a woman a long time ago who was in an unhappy marriage with her husband, and she had just come out as an late bloomer lesbian by the time I met her. We immediately bonded, made a fantastic friendship, both of our attention always 100% of the time on each other. It was a dream, every single day we were each other’s main focus, shared every thought and emotion together, and always had the exact kind of day it was for each other. We both thought that each other was the most beautiful woman in the world and we were genuinely surprised we were into each other. Thing have always been like that every single day ever since the day we met, sure it was love for sure, but it was also a special friendship, a true best friend. 
Okay so now about one week ago, I mistakenly let her down when we were supposed to hang out at a special event together we had planned. But for very complicated and unfortunate reasons, I wasn’t able to make it and I told her the day it was supposed to go down. She told me spending that day alone was the most hurt she’s ever felt and I was so so sincerely sorry. I regret what I did everyday and probably will forever. She’s put a ton of boundaries now, stripping away every little thing that made our friendship so special! She no longer wants to talk to me daily, she doesn’t physically want to see me irl (while she constantly tells me about how she’s trying hard to meet other people), she wants me to show no affection for her, all these small little details I loved about her are gone, and she overall told me she just wants a causal friendship now. The only thing that really stayed the same, is her promise to me that she’ll never leave me or abandon me.
My anxiety and depression has been tough on me to accept this is the way she wants things. Is it wrong for me hope that things might change back to how they were? Is she trying to replace me with someone else as her new best friend/lover? Does she hate me? Why does she hurt me and strip everything away that made our friendship so special?

I have fantasies about guys but I never really picture them it's just faceless just the idea. I keep telling myself I should at least have sex with a guy before I write it off but all my experiences with guys in person. I just dissociate. I kinda just cease to exist in the moment and float out of my body kind of like  that feeling.

4254,My boss is weird and sad I'm leaving the department,"Okay so,  when I was in training my gaydar practically screamed that my boss is gay. Then when she told me she had a kid I figured not. 

 That's only part of it.... she's  extremely chatty to me. She mentioned being a vegan like 91 times, is that code for something? She told me where she lives,  which is weird. OH and wanted me to put her number in my phone,  I'd only have to call her when I'm working (and its listed there) so that's weird.  She annoyed me, I need time to acclimate and I didn't get that before she was chatty and all buddy buddyey. She touched me a lot too, whenever I had to hand her something that's easy to avoid touching still touched me. I have a thing with touching.

Then we needed to go somewhere during work. She drove and kept ""getting lost"" she told work she knew the way before we left and somehow ""forgot"". 

Well I'm leaving the department, not because of her it's just that job and I don't get along. I really had to dig my heals in to get management to let me out. She's taking it really personally. I honestly feel kinda bad.

4256,Lesbian dream come true turned into nightmare (REPOST),"Lately everything has been extremely painful for me, just one of the most difficult obstacles for me to overcome. I met a woman a long time ago who was in an unhappy marriage with her husband, and she had just come out as an late bloomer lesbian by the time I met her. We immediately bonded, made a fantastic friendship, both of our attention always 100% of the time on each other. It was a dream, every single day we were each other’s main focus, shared every thought and emotion together, and always had the exact kind of day it was for each other. We both thought that each other was the most beautiful woman in the world and we were genuinely surprised we were into each other. Thing have always been like that every single day ever since the day we met, sure it was love for sure, but it was also a special friendship, a true best friend. 
Okay so now about one week ago, I mistakenly let her down when we were supposed to hang out at a special event together we had planned. But for very complicated and unfortunate reasons, I wasn’t able to make it and I told her the day it was supposed to go down. She told me spending that day alone was the most hurt she’s ever felt and I was so so sincerely sorry. I regret what I did everyday and probably will forever. She’s put a ton of boundaries now, stripping away every little thing that made our friendship so special! She no longer wants to talk to me daily, she doesn’t physically want to see me irl (while she constantly tells me about how she’s trying hard to meet other people), she wants me to show no affection for her, all these small little details I loved about her are gone, and she overall told me she just wants a causal friendship now. The only thing that really stayed the same, is her promise to me that she’ll never leave me or abandon me.
My anxiety and depression has been tough on me to accept this is the way she wants things. Is it wrong for me hope that things might change back to how they were? Is she trying to replace me with someone else as her new best friend/lover? Does she hate me? Why does she hurt me and strip everything away that made our friendship so special?

4261,Painful Sex as a Queer Person,"*[TW: mention of sexual abuse (no details)]*

Hi folks! I’m an AFAB queer person, and I’ve started dating around recently. But whenever things seem like they might be going somewhere, I get nervous because I think about how painful penetration can be for me if things get sexual.

I’m 99% certain I have vaginismus, but I’m also gonna schedule an appointment with my gyno just to be sure. This is something I’ve dealt with for as long as I can remember. Like, even tampons have always been an issue for me, so I only use pads. I do have a history of sexual abuse though from when I was a kid/teenager, so that’s probably a factor in how my body responds to sexual things too.

One (or sometimes two) fingers is somehow okay, but any sort of small vibrator or dildo even slightly thicker than that hurts like CRAZY— even with lube! And getting exams at the gyno’s office hurts with their speculum too.

I know there are ways to have sex that don’t involve penetration, but there are some things I want to try that do involve it (like strap-ons).

Has anybody here ever experienced this? And if so, how were you able to work through it? I know I shouldn’t feel ashamed, but I do and it sucks to feel broken and defective in this way.

TL;DR - Penetration hurts for me, and I don’t know how to work through it. Anybody have experience with this?",actuallesbians,1579814548,motioncitysoundwhack,,1,True,2020-01-23

4265,I need LGBT book suggestions for my school library!,"I'm asking around on various LGBT subreddits for LGBT+ book suggestions for my school library. The librarian lets us put on displays of books on various themes, and send out an email about why the theme is important, so I thought that one for pride month would be perfect. (I know it's ages away, but I'd rather be prepared.)


LGBT fiction and non fiction is so important. I'm sure all of us could do with some good book suggestions. But it's also important because books are catalysts for empathy, and are a brilliant way to help people support our wonderful community. 


I'm looking for anything with an LGBT theme - so novels with an LGBT protagonist or sub plot etc., or non fiction that's interesting and informative. As long as it's good for teenage and young adult readers, and you've enjoyed it, please suggest it! Films are fine too, but I'm mostly looking for books.

Even her friends feel the same way too, which was nice to hear that I’m not being unreasonable. 

She used to be really sweet and kind, not just to me but to people in general. But the last 2 months or so of our relationship actually kinda sucked looking back, I definitely was putting in more of the work and it felt really limiting and like I constantly felt unwanted and had to fight for her attention. I felt like I was a really good gf to her, was always there for her and genuinely loved her. It’s such a struggle because I still love her but the old her, I hate the insensitive person that she has become. 

It’s good that I’m making these realizations and moving on but I also miss the memories back when she wasn’t terrible and wish I could go back... I just wanna cuddle again, hold hands with someone, have someone rub my thigh and go on car rides and talk about deep things, laugh, make out, and the rest.

Please tell me how to fix this!","We’re both queer women in college, and we’ve been friends for over a year now. I feel terrible about this situation because I know it’s partially my fault.

I met her during a horrible time of my life, after I’d driven away all my friends through alcohol &amp; trauma-fueled breakdowns. Since she was one of the only people I talked to at that point, and I was in a bad place, I clung to her as a source of strength. I developed a crush on her that persisted through the semester of medical leave I took. She became my reason to work on my mental health and get back to school. We would message frequently. I never made my feelings explicit, and even tried to hide them, but I can see how she’d get a romantic vibe. However, six months of not seeing her lead to me idealizing her to an impossible extent. After I got back, I realized that she wasn’t the person I’d invented in my head, and I didn’t see her in a romantic light anymore. I pulled back from her, and we continued what I thought was a platonic friendship. I feared I was straight for a while, but I’ve since gone on dates with another woman and realized I’m still queer lol.

I moved on from my crush pretty quickly, and though I suspected she had feelings for me, I thought she’d forgotten those as well. Since I returned two sems ago, she’s pursued a couple women and been on dates. However, a couple days ago, I was complaining again about not wanting to be single for Valentine’s Day. (I’ll admit this is annoying, I was partially joking and have since stopped). She kind of snapped and told me to stop complaining because she’d had a yearlong crush on me. I was shocked. I told her that I’m sorry if I did anything to lead her on. We had a conversation and she acknowledged that I don’t return her feelings, and said she wants to continue our friendship as normal.

But things are awkward now. I can hardly look her in the eyes. I usually hang at their place for hours every day, but I’m hiding in a classroom typing this now because our conversations are so awkward. There’s a weird tension we can’t seem to shake. Our mutual friends are oblivious, which makes it worse. I feel horrible for potentially leading her on, and I wish we could return to normal. And she’s still one of my few friends, so if I lose her over this I’ll be alone again. I’m sad for hurting her, and I want to make things right for us.
How do I fix this? Should I blame myself?

4311,I'm finally being me but I feel like a second class citizen sometimes. I can't help but feel shame,"I [28F] was a little late coming out of the closet and to my family at the age of 26. It was a long and sometimes painful process coming to the realization that I was a lesbian. The process included being in a relationship with a guy for 7 years who wasn't that great to me. He was controlling, overbearing, talked down to me a lot, and made sure that I knew that he was smarter than me and would remind me whenever he got a chance. It was a tough time but family never batted an eye and were even surprised when we broke up. 
When I came out of the closet shortly after the break up, my family (not all but many) were mortified regardless of my newly found happiness. I am with the most gentle and caring woman that I have ever met and she adds so much to my happiness and so much to our lives in general. There have been quiet disapprovals for the last two years while being with her. 
When she eventually proposed to me, the first person I told was my brother. I called him and was crying of happiness when I told him. His response? ""Oh, are you happy? Congrats I guess."" That was hard to swallow even though he didn't say anything outwardly negative. It was his and other people's indifference towards my fiancée and I that hurt the most.  
I just found out that we did not get an engagement party because people were too busy""processing"" the news about me. 
We are getting married in 5 months and things have improved but this evening when taking with my grandma who suffers from a milder dementia asked me: ""who's the lucky fella that is marrying you this summer?"" I reminded her of her name. Her response? ""Another woman?? That's interesting..."" and dropped the topic immediately. 
Small stuff like that shouldn't bother me but it's stuff like that that I noticed did not happen when I was dating the guy who treated me kinda crappy. Since that former relationship ""looked right"" I guess that means it was worthy of celebration whereas my current healthy life is not and it makes me feel like less of a person. 
Idk what I'm looking for but I just wanted to know if there are others who experience the same and how do you let this type of stuff roll off your shoulder?",actuallesbians,1579840644,mu99le77,,1,True,2020-01-23

Dating apps suck because nothing ever leads anywhere, and in my real life I'm paranoid that every girl around me must be straight so I can't bring myself to flirt or anything of the like. (I've only had one real girlfriend, although it lasted all of a little more than a month because it got really abusive really fast). Just... gosh I feel like I'm wasting my life away, all because I want (read: need) a sparkling connection with a girl. I'd even be open to hookups, hell, a first kiss even. but I really think I'm at stalemate in anything romantic or otherwise. I'm honestly just so lonely that I can't even imagine a world that I \~miraculously\~ have a girl in my life. at the same time, that terrifies me because  I don't think I can take if I don't -- thats a big fear in my life now, especially since my cousin died recently and he was in his 20s. like, what if that was me? I. would have died without really being with anyone. most days I cope by studying hard in school so I don't have time to engage in a pity party, but some times the meltdowns just come anyways (like now! yay!). this is just a vent, I'm terrified for the future, and I hate how I'm such an awful fuckup that I can't even be with a girl. the loneliness is honestly so extreme that I can't take it . anyways sorry that this was ranty and has probably a lot of grammar/whatever errors, its because I'm literally crying as I write this and I can't see the screen lol",actuallesbians,1579844108,prettysadthing,,1,True,2020-01-24

4318,HELP! Being intimate with my partner is hard because....,"She has the perfect everything. She’s cute and short. Pretty and long brown hair. Big boobs. Her stomach is just so cute I can’t explain. Her thighs! Her butt! It’s all perfect. I feel like the opposite. My proportions are out of wack. I’m about five inches taller than her. I can’t gain weight and I just look sickly. I feel too skinny. Barely a B cup. My butt is nonexistent. Completely flat, just like my chest. But what I’m most insecure about is my vulva. I’m never hypercritical of other people’s vulvas, but I am of my own. She basically has no visible labia minora. And mine feel so big. Too big. It’s a giant insecurity of mine. I already have to deal with that everyday by myself and with someone else it’s just hard. Sex with her is amazing. In the moment I don’t think about it at all. But afterwards I feel so awful because I can’t stop wondering if she’s grossed out about my body. She knows I’m insecure in general, but doesn’t know specifically what bothers me.

4319,I need help,"I confessed my feelings to my (long distance) fwb (we only slept together once, but she was my first) and she gently rejected me. 

So, trying to get over my fwb, I went on a date with another girl who apparently just got out of a super long term relationship. I almost got laid on the first date but I stopped her because I didn't want to mess her up cause she's clearly not over her ex. She agreed and thanked me, but now she's really confused. 

Now I'm just giving her space and waiting for her bc I like her. I told her we can go as slow as she wants and I'm not looking for a one night stand nor am I looking for a serious relationship rn. But it's super (sexually) frustrating and honestly I don't think she should be dating rn, and now I don't think I should be either. I am very honest with her about all of this. Lowkey we both just kind of want to have sex with each other but are wary about how she'll feel after.

I was fine before I went on a date with her, living my best life and kind of aloof on our date, but now I am super distracted and all I do is wait around for her infrequent texts (like once a day), which is super unhealthy.

My question is what should I do? Should I just let her go and/or not sleep with her? None of this seems to really be healthy for me or for her. But I do want to get laid and I am mostly over my fwb.",actuallesbians,1579850194,Cuddlypup7,,1,True,2020-01-24
4320,Take a step back and realize.,"So for the past 5 years I have been seeing this amazing woman. She has been more than I could ever ask for in a friend, soulmate and lover. About 11 months ago we started to get so shaky and we started to “second guess”. Arguments occurred more often and we started to “keep score” and it got to the whole “tit for tat” game. It was terrible!!!! And every Time we apologized we said things were going to change. But nothing changed. It was the same circle of crap. 

When month 5 of constant argument came a series of tragic events started to occur. Our kitty had passed, she lost her job and our rent went up drastically to where we could not afford it and forced to move out. We even decided to take a break from each other. Which solved nothing because we were running and hiding from our problems. 

At that point we sat down and had the most amazing talk about life and our goals and just things we would dream and fantasize about when we first started to date. We got so close minded and wrapped up in life that we lost sight on what was important to us. And that was each other. After having that talk and working through our issues together we became so much more than we could ever imagine. I swear I fall in love with her more and more every single day. 

If I could go back and give “11 month ago” me some advice it would’ve been step back and see the bigger picture and don’t forget why you chose that person from day 1. I wish we would’ve had the talk  much earlier before letting things get so bad for months. Working through my issues and hers as well as a team made us so much stronger.

4324,I’ve been talking to this girl but my insecurities are ruining it,"There’s this girl I’ve been talking to for maybe a month and a half or so now. We’ve been friends for over a year and very close friends since summer. I adore her. I think she’s perfect! Kind, caring, beautiful, compassionate. Simply everything you could ever want in a person. I want to ask her to be my girlfriend so so badly. But I can’t help second guessing everything because of my own insecurities. I am scared she is settling on my subpar (at best) body. She has every feature I could ever dream of having. She deserves better than me. I hate my body. A lot. I’ve been obsessing over my flaws lately. She tells me all the time that she thinks I’m pretty, beautiful, etc. I appreciate it a lot, I really do, but no amount of compliments will fix the flaws I see in myself. When we have sex I’m totally there and enjoying it in the moment but as soon as it’s over all I can think about is how she is probably thinking that my body is disgusting. I know I’m being illogical and if she thought I was gross she wouldn’t sleep with me. But that doesn’t mean that she might find parts of me off putting? And what if she hates the specific parts I hate too? She knows I’m insecure. She doesn’t know what specifically bothers me and I don’t even feel comfortable enough to say it. That’s how bad my insecurity is. It’s eating me up inside. I don’t know what to do. Some weeks I feel okay and some weeks I feel awful. I am bipolar and in the middle of a depressive episode so it would make sense for it to be worse than usual right now but I just don’t know what to do about it.

4325,Does anyone have any advice on how to stop crushing hard on someone??,"So, here's my situation... there's this one girl I work with who I've been crushing on for a a while now, and she's so pretty and unique and cool and I can't keep my mind off her... Of course I never had the guts to make a move on her. But I started getting the vibe that maybe she had a thing for me too, because the few times that we would talk she wouldn't stop smiling and acting all cute and shy, and she would even get nervous and hide her face a little. 

Well, A mutual friend told me while I was away seeing family for the holidays that that girl has totally been attracted to me big time, but also mentioned that she just got into a relationship with a guy. From what I've gathered, it'll probably be a long-term thing. 

Lately it's been feeling like she's becoming less approachable, more reserved, and less willing to talk to me. I don't know, maybe it's just me searching for a pattern that isn't there. But we work the same shift every day and I always get a knot in my stomach when I see her because she's just so awesome. I honestly already feel kind of ashamed and a little predatory for being attracted to girls in the first place, but I feel like I'm getting myself into a really unhealthy mental thing by obsessing over someone who's already taken and who a relationship with is probably outside of the realm of possibility. I keep seeing her and thinking about her and dreaming about her and... ugh... I just want it all to stop so badly. I really want to stop crushing so hard on her and just move on with my life and feel more okay trying to find someone to connect with on a dating app where I don't even have to wonder if another girl is gay.

4336,I‘m in love with two girls and I don‘t know what to do,"I didn’t want to post this on a regular dating subreddit, I hope posts like this are allowed. I’m new to reddit sorry! 

Okay, so I feel like an asshole, but I never intended to actually fall in love with Katie (not real name). We met while I was on a 5week trip in Malaysia and Bhutan, we were in the same travel group for 21days so we saw each other everday and became friends quickly. I never inteded to start anything romantical with her, especially since she was there with her (now ex)boyfriend (she‘s bi).

I have a girlfriend, Jenny (again fake name). She‘s amazing, we‘ve been dating for 8 months now, met in school, she was a new, shy, cute and very obvious lesbian (she wore a lgbt shirt on her first day and has a rainbow tattoo on her wrist). We connected instantly on the first day of school, both love anime and walking our dogs. It‘s been amazing dating her, but...

I‘ve been getting closer to Katie and I think I‘ve realized that I REALLY like her. If I‘m being completely honest, Katie is a way better match than Jenny. We‘re both into photography and filmmaking, we both love travelling while Jenny would never set foot on a plane, we both love the same music while me and Jenny only have very few things we both like. But I love Jenny I really do and now that Katie is broken up with her guy and has made advances towards me that one could perceive as sexual/romantical intrest. 

Katie seems like the better choice but she‘s also an unknown danger. What if it doesn‘t work out? While my relationship with Jenny may be boring at times, it‘s stable and calm, we never flight and whenever we spend time it‘s very pleasant and comfortable. Do I want to lose that? Do I have to tell my girlfriend about Katie? I‘m sure I could forget her if I tried and blocked her and just kept dating Jenny, but would I regret that?

I've met someone here on reddit, we're both pretty gay honestly, but I thought I wouldn't catch them feelings you know, we played some games before and I've joined in voice calls with her, but not always. You know when someone just grows on you and you start catching feelings. Then you just sit there afraid of asking her out, cause she already told you that she's not emotionally available and you're afraid of rejection. I just wanna ask if you can unlike someone romantically, is that even a valid concept?

I swear I've been fighting with myself these days and yes I am hard on myself with these things, cause I can never have happiness or nice things. Honestly I'm feeling really hurt from just the concept of her rejecting me.",actuallesbians,1579875792,actuallyunstable,,1,True,2020-01-24

Then I talk to my other friend who’s gay and she goes “oh you spoke with [girl’s name] she’s always staring at me is she queer.”

Recently came out a few months ago and have been dating this girl for a month now. We aren't anything official, we have just been going on dates, making out, holding hands, and being super touchy with each other.

I was wondering how many dates or how long did it take before you both did the nasty lol.

Currently i am staying at my family's (they don't know Im into girls.

4362,I’m upset with the way my girlfriend handled my first time,"My girlfriend was getting a weird numb feeling in her legs for around a month (she is fine now don’t worry). During this she was worried and laying in bed a lot. Still she would tease me a lot, touching me and getting me worked up, but refuse sex at the end saying she doesn’t feel good. 

Normally we had high sex drives and were kinky so this was new. I felt rejected. I said if she’s going to not have sex at least don’t touch me and keep telling me what you’re going to do to me. She would feel me up throughout the day and I started telling her to back off.

Around when this started (can’t remember if slightly before or slightly after), I had mentioned to her that I wanted to try anal with her. I kept telling her that I was so excited because my vaginal virginity was lost in a meaningless way, and I felt happy thinking I could “give” this to someone I loved. I was so excited and happy about it. She kept telling me she would love that, and again telling me the whole day that when she gets home she’s going to blahblahblah. So many times I prepared only to have her say no. 

I started not being as sympathetic to her feelings as I could’ve been. She was upset. I asked if she just didn’t want to do it, which made her more upset. We had some arguments about it before one night she started touching there. I stopped her and told her that if it’s just for my sake I don’t want to, that I want it to mean something. She insisted that she wants it. 

So we did it. It felt mechanical and weird. Like it was to pacify me rather than something passionate like I hoped for. It ended quickly and I felt weird about it. 

She asked me how it was, and I tried to sound cheerful. “It was okay,” I said. “Not as good as I thought it’d be.”

“... Are you kidding me?” she says. I’m like “what?” 

“You put me through hell, and that’s it? I thought you’d be all romantic and happy after all that.” 

We got into a big argument. I said that I know I wasn’t being as sympathetic but this meant something to me and I wished it never happened. She said she’s sorry but she doesn’t think it seemed like I cared much based on my reaction, and that I haven’t been there for her while she’s been worried about her health like I should’ve been. 

We both apologized and I said to pretend it never happened. We haven’t talked about it since. She hasn’t touched me there again, though I’ve touched her there, and I forgot it even happened... Today I thought about doing it with her, and I felt this strong “don’t!!” reaction from me. After a while I remembered it all.

4373,Why I Never Got A Girlfriend,"It wasn't for lack of trying. I've fallen in love with women. Twice. Day dreamed about settling down with a woman in a cottage with a dog. Dreamt of kissing them. I wrote poetry about female friends I had crushes on. Read lesbian romance novels. Used dating apps, though I could never get the conversation from friendly small talk to ""so, wanna get coffee sometime?"". 

Finding men to date was so easy. Finding women to date was so hard.

It was because I grew up in a small, conservative town cut off from anywhere central, anywhere with a proper LGBT+ community or dating scene.

It was because my mother was disgusted by my sexuality, and I felt guilty for liking other girls. I felt too much like a bad daughter. A disappointment. 

It was because I was used to the other person making the first move, which men usually find easy, and women a lot more difficult. 

It was because I don't look like the sort of person who likes girls- all floral print dresses and long hair and ballet flats. Any woman who looked at me would assume I'm straight, so why would they bother asking me out?

It was because I had PTSD, and wasn't ready for a relationship with anyone for a long time. 

It was because most of the women I liked were straight.

It was because there just aren't that many of us, and a lot of us are already coupled up.

That's why I never got a girlfriend.",actuallesbians,1579889351,stillhavehope99,Bi,1,True,2020-01-24
4374,post break up friendship,"hi all, first time posting here and I need some advice.

My ex and i just broke up a couple days ago and i'm having trouble adjusting. We met at school and started dating, but I have now transferred schools creating a 2600 mile distance between us. Before I left we talked, and I was open to a long distance relationship but she felt that she wouldn't be able to feel happy and committed to a relationship that wasn't in person. I was hurt by that, but I more than anything respect her and want her to be happy and would walk away from the relationship if it wasn't going to make her happy. We sat together and cried for about two hours talking about how we'd miss each other and only want each other to be happy and how we'd miss each other. 

We both have expressed the desire to remain good friends and be in each others lives because we still love each other and care about them, but I'm struggling to navigate how to be just friends while I still love her. It's been hard because there was nothing toxic or unhappy in the relationship, it was just ended by the intense distance. I know I need time away to set boundaries for myself so that I'm not hurt or leading myself on, but I just miss her so much.

4385,"[TW: Depression] I don't know what the ""right"" thing to do is.","Hey raptors, I'm posting here since you're such a supportive community and I feel like you have a diverse set of backgrounds that might help with answering my question. Sorry if this gets rambly.

**TLDR:** My GF is depressed and I feel unloved.

My GF and I (both around 30) have been together about 2.5 years. I moved in to her place in August. 

She suffers from depression, and I don't know a whole lot about it. I've been trying to learn but I still don't understand a lot of what goes on, partly because it's so individual, and partly because she's not very good at talking about it. 

Mostly she is stressed - she's self-employed and finally in the green after a few years. I helped by cosigning a consolidation loan about a year into our relationship so she could get out from under 20+% interest and make headway on her debt. She's constantly taking on more work but has trouble managing her workload, time, and bad days. She doesn't like what she does (bookkeeping) and wants to move into more fulfilling and better paying accountant work but it's hard when she's still swamped with the old work that she needs to 1) pay the bills, and 2) keep good relationships with clients who refer her to others. She recently hired someone but now there's more overhead of managing them, which isn't as much less work as she was hoping for when she decided to hand off some of the work. 

The thing is, I'm a giver. Acts of Service is my love language and I like to help. So, I do most of the housework and cooking. I sometimes pick up odd jobs she has from her work, like data entry, and writing/editing/coding for her website.

I feel like our lives are centered in her work. Because she works so much in the evenings, we rarely have dates. When we do, we talk about work. I feel like we're both always so focused on *her work* we don't do the things we need to to improve the relationship (eg. We still have boxes from when I moved in and it's a small space, but she doesn't have time to move her stuff around to make room for mine). Because stress kills her libido, I also feel more like her assistant than her girlfriend sometimes.  

When she has bad days, she hates everything. She has admitted she doesn't love me at these times because she can't. She's just numb. She can't be empathetic either - she was having a bad day when I got the news my grandmother had a stroke and I was very worried she would die and I'd never see her again (another country). I tried to talk to her but she snapped at me that she'd never get to see her whole extended family again either (homophobic, also different country). I went and cried alone. 

I can tell her mood is bad just over text and I hate going home at these times. I'm trying to be better at separating this since I've learned she's not usually mad at me or because of anything I've done, but it's still hard. She's easily irritated and the smallest thing can result in an angry outburst or a passive-aggressive comment. 

It's hard because I don't know how to react when she's hating on herself. ""I love you"" gets met with ""I don't know why, you deserve better."" I try to refute these things but it only seems to upset her more. 

It's also hard because honestly, I do think I deserve better. I deserve to be loved all the time, and I certainly don't deserve to be hated by the person I love. I should feel emotionally safe in my own home. I deserve someone who is willing to put the se amount of effort into the relationship as I am. 

I've made a lot of changes in this relationship. I am vegetarian now, not because she asked me but beacuase I listened to her reasoning and came to the conclusion she was right (not looking to get into that argument here please). I am married to my Google calendar because my forgetfulness bothered her so now I forget less. I cook for us even though I dislike it because she can't feed herself while stressed/depressed unless the meal is already ready. I moved in with her because she didn't like my neighborhood even though I could walk to work there and now I have an hour transit each way. I went to therapy to work on a lot of personal stuff so our relationship could be better. All of this is good stuff, and I'm not upset at the changes. 

But when she says I deserve better, I sometimes suggest she can make the changes to be the person I deserve. She just kinda shuts down on that one. Sometimes I bring it up when we are talking about the health of our relationship and she talks about how this won't change. I don't expect her to be cured of depression but I do expect her to make a conscious effort to get her workload manageable and reduce her stress. She just snaps ""don't you think I want that too?"" But the conversation doesn't seem to go anywhere. She's probably just as frustrated as me and doesn't see a way to do it. The only thing she says helps is regular meditation, but I've also had to do most of the leg work for this to happen. 

Sometimes I find myself fantasizing about getting hurt or sick. I realize this is because those are the only times I get the kind of attention from her that I crave. It's when I feel loved. I haven't told her this. (I'm not at risk of self-harm.)

She says she's worried we'll break up because I can't ""handle"" her depression and it can get a lot worse than this, and she can't take care of both of us. I've reminded her that just because I cry doesn't mean she needs to ""take care"" of me and I'm allowed to have feelings, that doesn't make me weak and unable to ""handle"" her. 

At the same time this feels manipulative to me. Like framing standing up for my feelings and pushing back on blame when she's upset at me for nothing as ""weakness"" isn't right.

Recently I have been spending a lot of time following subs about van life, tiny housing, digital nomading, and I think a lot of it is escapism because I'm not happy. Recently I wasn't feeling well and she was cuddling me and comforting me and it just made my heart hurt. Why can't it be like that all the time?

I just don't know. I feel like I could deal with her depression if she wanted to make a change. But it feels oftentimes like she doesn't. It feels like she likes work more than me. Her father is a workaholic and she hates that about him, but seems to be falling into similar patterns, maybe. Is it a dick move to point this out?

Everyone deserves love and support, which includes her. But it also includes me and I feel like I'm being an asshole if I leave her to fend for herself and I go look for love elsewhere. /r/depression is full of people heartbroken that their depression led their SOs to leave them. I don't want to be one of them but I also recognize that my own emotional health is suffering. 

I hear settings ng boundaries helps, but I don't know what to set. Should I ask for a day set aside for not-work? Maybe two evenings, one for a date and the other for housework type stuff? But is there anything else I could do?",actuallesbians,1579894688,RussetWolf,"Not quite andro, not quite butch. I'm just manly, I guess.",1,True,2020-01-24
4386,[Help] Is never coming out okay? Is it necessary to come out?,"My best friend is in the closet at age 31. Her mother is homophobic, a christian zealot, a tr*mp supporter, the whole deal. Also criminally stupid. It was something her father acknowledged about her mother before he died -- my friend inherited his intelligence, not hers.

Most people in her life know she's gay, but no one in her family knows. She genuinely does love and like her mom, although there are things about her childhood home environment and hometown that deeply depress her. I think that her being in the closet is the one thing holding her back from pursuing relationships, and that if she told her mom, things would start coming together for her. She's hot and brilliant and hilarious but stunted as far as relationships go. I know she wants to meet someone, but she never tries to, and I think the fact that as far as her family is concerned, her being with a woman isn't even in the realm of possibility, that sort of makes it a no-go for her.

I want to know if I should work to encourage her to come out to her mom, or just let it be. We are incredibly, incredibly close and she values my opinion, so if I make a good enough case she might consider it. But I don't want to put her through unnecessary bullshit, if it's actually possible that coming out to her mother would do nothing to improve her life. I'm wondering what you guys think about the possibility of her never, ever, ever coming out. What does that do to a person? What does that do to a family?

I'm straight, close to her age, in a relationship. I'd say my experience with lesbian-specific matters comes down to every close friend I've ever had being a lesbian. I've had sex with women and am a little attracted to some girls but I don't have interest in being with women at all, not even like making out while drunk.

4393,I’ve been so happy for ages but I have no one to tell,"Okay, so long time lurker, first time poster, formatting on mobile. 

So, I’m a 21 year old loser who grew up single, went to college, and the singleness persisted. My friend got me to make a Twitter for a shared interest we had and I found some people with mutual interests, made a few friends and life was good.

One such online friend was this adorable girl who I met in a group chat. We clicked on day one and basically sent messages between each other daily for months. I was hardcore smitten because to me she was the cutest and funniest girl in the world. Only problem, was that she wasn’t in my part of the world. I lived in the US and she was in the UK. 

Fast forward a few months, I finally gathered up courage to ask this cutie out and she actually said yes!! I was shocked, but she was always just so cute I was so happy. I never went out with anyone before, never mind a primarily online relationship, but I was determined to do the best with it. 

Well, this past New Year’s I went to London with my sister (coming from America) and the. Took a bus ride to where she lived!! And actually met her in person!

Y’all when I say I wanted to cry when I saw her, it was no joke. I immediately went into useless lesbian mode™️ and was super awkward for the whole first day. She was just so precious I wanted to combust. I found myself just wanting to listen to everything she said because it just meant the world to me that we were even doing this. She stayed in my hotel room with me and we snuggled and it was amazing!

We spent the next like three days together and I couldn’t get over how amazing it was to happily walk around with my girlfriend and be able to just hang out with her. I have never been happier in my life and I only realized that loving her was my favorite thing in the world. It was basically like being on a date for several days and it was essentially heaven. I even got to meet her parents and they were super cool about her dating someone who she met online. 

Returning to the states sucked, but the fact I was able to see and be with her made me so happy. I’m excited for the next time we can see each other, though I’m not ready to be useless again because she’s so pretty and I just get stunned every time I see her. 

I have no one I can talk about this with, so I thought that I may as well talk about it here. Thanks for listening to me and please know that for anyone struggling, you can always find someone for you somewhere! Stay strong ❤️",actuallesbians,1579899852,CptSnowflakeSparkle,,1,True,2020-01-24

One of my friends is in that group and I'm not out as bisexual, so I used gender-neutral pronouns for the story and everyone assumed I was talking about a guy. Lol. I want to see if the general advice I get changes from a WLW community. for context, my crush and I are in our early 20s (I'm a year older) and we're both bisexual

After multiple attempts of me stepping out of my comfort zone, my crush and I are friends now. We flirt and get personal with each other. We message a lot but we've never hung out 1on1 before. We've only recently became friends. I think I might be hanging out with her 1on1 next week

My crush likes to mention her Tinder encounters and jokes a lot about her matches. *The catch?* My crush and I matched on Tinder (2016) a long time before we actually met (2017) (we met because of reasons unrelated to Tinder.) After we met, I realized we matched on Tinder and I was embarrassed/avoided talking to her for the longest time. I thought she hated me for some reason?? Her and I never messaged each other, but we're still matched. I talked to her a few times in early 2019 and realized 1) she didn't hate me 2) she's cool to talk to. I realized I still had a crush on her. Our schedules matched up later in the year so I started talking to her more often, and we're friends now

**Every time my crush brings up Tinder, I get tempted to bring up the fact that we matched on Tinder. Would doing this a bad idea?** The biggest con I can think of is that she might not remember that we matched and might find it creepy that I remembered. 2016 was a long time ago

4401,Can anyone recommend mutually pleasurable strap ons or other toys?,"Ok so before you read this I wanna say I go into gross detail about my sex life to explain my issue so you can click off if that’ll make you uncomfortable lol. 

Anyway! Me and my girlfriend will have been together for 5 years next month so I feel like it’s far overdue that I ask for advice on this, but whatever. 

My girlfriend is gay and doesn’t get off on penetration; I’m bisexual and I very much prefer it to other things like oral or whatever. Usually when we have penetrative sex, she’ll use a regular strap on and I’ll give her oral after she’s made me come because she isn’t able to come just from fucking me. She doesn’t seem to mind it, it’s not that she doesn’t enjoy doing that for me but I’ve always felt kind of bad that she doesn’t get much out of it, physically. Are there any toys you can recommend that stimulate the wearer but aren’t penetrative to them? Most of the toys I see that are supposed to please both parties have to be inside the top and my girlfriend wouldn’t enjoy that. Is there some kind that would stimulate the wearer’s clit or something like that? I want a way for me and my girl to have sex with mutual enjoyment, and humping really isn’t that satisfying lmao. 

Thanks for any help :)",actuallesbians,1579903283,handyritey,,1,True,2020-01-24
4402,It ain’t easy being GNC,"Just need to vent...
God, I feel like a freak in women’s spaces. I can’t relate to the average woman and I feel so isolated. But I’m not a guy, and I wouldn’t say I’m NB either. I am a woman, but I just don’t feel comfortable with many of the things that come with that. 

For context, I went to a hairdresser today and that’s what triggered these feelings. I’ve always hated getting my hair cut but I only now realized why that is. All the pictures are of extremely feminine women with a ton of makeup on and hair that someone probably spent 5 hours on. It makes me so uncomfortable because I don’t want to look like that, and when you ask for a non-feminine haircut, they’ll still somehow manage to make it super feminine no matter how clearly you try to explain it or even show pictures. You either end up looking like a Karen or just something else that isn’t what you wanted and you don’t recognize yourself anymore and none of it feels like _you_ and when you get home you just undo the styling and cry because you hate it. 

(Imagine beng a preteen and having to explain to your hairdresser that you want to have a boys’ hairstyle and not style it because you’re ”trying to be environmental-friendly and [you] just don’t care about looking ’good’”! God, I was so gay. (And a lonely activist. I love that nowadays kids care about the climate as well. It wasn’t exactly the hottest topic in the schoolyard 10 years ago.)

And I’m not even that masculine! I used to be very masc, but that was when I thought I was a trans guy. That was also not easy - wouldn’t want to experience the rampant transphobia again - but at least my gender and gender expression was understood (that is, when I passed and/or was around accepting people). Now, it’s like, what even are you? You’re a girl but you want to wear men’s clothes? Unheard of. 

It will hopefully get better when I move to a bigger city. Won’t feel like a freak anymore.",actuallesbians,1579903561,spidey-klum,,1,True,2020-01-24
4403,Catching Feels Again (A Useless Lesbian Story),"Background: So back in August, I met one of my classmates and instantly caught feels for her, Fast forward to now and we're good friends.

 So anyway I just got back from an overnight school trip, during that trip we went to see an exhibit, and our teacher told us to get in groups because their were at least 200 people in the exhibit. Her Friend, Her, and I decided to get in a group, we were lined next to each other in that order. Since there are so many people in the room we decide to hold on to each others hoodies/jackets, so my crush grabs onto her friend's hoodie, and decides she would hold my hand. When she did this I started freaking out like the useless lesbian I am. You see the thing is earlier in 2019  another friend of mine asked what my crush's sexuality was and she replied ""Well I've never dated anyone so I wouldn't know"". However, another time we were creating characters for a DnD campaign and we had the bright idea to roll for the big gay, she rolled a 20 two times, and paid 50 gold to remove the big gay from her character. Now my question is: does she like girls?

tl;dr: I catch feels for a girl because she holds my hand and my useless lesbian ass can't tell if she likes girls",actuallesbians,1579903820,Kcbr207,Lesbian,1,True,2020-01-24

4410,Why am I like this?,"Tl;dr: I'm gay and more or less cool with it but have trouble telling old friends. Why?


Background: I'm gay and pretty much always have been, except that I'm the last person on this earth to have figured that one out. I'm the kind of gay who hasn't worn a dress since attending her best friend's bat mitzvah at the end of eighth grade which was almost a decade ago. The kind that declared, as a sophomore, that she would cut her hair short (""like a boy"") after graduating high school and followed through with that promise much to her dad's disgust. The kind that loved AP World History a little too much because the teacher was a total badass. The kind that decided to have a crush on Stephen (because he was smart) when talking about boys during sleepovers.

The signs have always been there, but I couldn't put one and one together until far more recently. Now I'm a 23 year old woman-child of sorts, neck deep in uni, who missed out on the sort of discover period that straight people take for granted. I've only ever kissed one girl and one guy, neither of which I was really prepared for in the sense that I felt like something was taken from me without my permission. I've always been a very shy, passive person who hates to rock the boat in any way, but in recent years I've come out of my shell and, through a lot of tears and what were probably undiagnosed depressive episodes, become a stronger, more confident woman than I've ever been before. I've gotten to the point where I will tell people I'm not straight if they explicitly ask and there is literally no way to avoid the fact. But here is my question..


My question: Why is it so hard for me to just say ""I'm a lesbian""? Like there have been a couple of situations where I've been literally wedged between peer pressure and an open closet door and instead of taking the step out, I turn the conversation into awkward silence. Or, for example, if I meet new people who I know are queer, I code queer enough to enter that social circle without really have to verbally confirm that yes, I'm gay. But even there I find it easier to come out to people who I met after having figured this out about myself, while I just seen unable to talk about it with my older friends. Am I just being my prudish self or has anyone else had this experience as well? Please tell me it gets better and how to make it better",actuallesbians,1579907443,delizaurio,,1,True,2020-01-24

4412,I really don’t feel good tonight,"I‘m starting to lose hope that I‘ll ever find a girlfriend. I know I shouldn’t base all of my life‘s happiness on a romantic relationship, and I‘m not. I have great friends and relatives and I‘m going to uni to educate myself. I‘ve also been establishing hobbies and working on myself thoroughly for at least the past year. 
And yet I can’t shake the feeling of a shadow haunting me. The shadow of a happiness that could be if only I managed to find someone to fall in love with. I don’t exactly love myself, but why isn’t there a single soul that’s into me when the people around me get into multiple relationships and flings throughout their early years of life? I feel so stuck in this place of my life and no amount of tossing and turning pushes me any further. Maybe I just wasn’t made for loving, not in that way at least. And I‘m probably not attractive enough for people to consider flirting with. 
It makes me question if being attracted to girls is even relevant to my identity at all if I can never act on it. I used to think that coming out/ coming to terms with your sexuality was the hardest part. Now, however, I‘m starting to think it might be being truthful to yourself but not in the position to surrender to your passions.

4414,School crush,"In grade 7 you had your first crush. 

She was, as far as you can remember, kind, cute, smart and most of all, your cheeks became beet red when you played together. 

You, as a 10 year old, were crushing all over her without even knowing what it was. 

Although you were really shy you just wanted to play with her. 

Then came high school and you never saw her again. 

Devastating you know, but time went by and you thought less and less about her. 

You were now a freshman, and you had other things to do then to crush on someone, right?

Wrong. The first time you met your new class, you knew you would like her. And you did. 

Spoiler alert, it never went anywhere. 

Again too shy and too self conscious to even make small talk with her. You had a sparkle of hope though, because someone in class said she liked you. 

This crush went on for two years. 

During this time, you came to the understanding that liking a girl while being a girl was not normal, even though you never felt abnormal.

You just liked someone and you wanted to be with them. Most normal case in the world right? 

Then this girl came around. You never thought you would like her but here you just did. 

Again, same old story, you wanted to spend every time in the world with her and this time, you thought this could have a change: the signs were there, or so you thought. 

You sent her a message confessing your “oh so small crush”. In hindsight it was not a very thoughtful way to let someone you like know trough this medium. But hey, that is looking back at it. You just couldn’t keep it to yourself any more. 

She took it so well even though she did not feel the same way. You were so relieved to finally get this weight off of your chest. You had chosen the best person to have a crush on. 

This happened over the course of three years. 

You are now senior and almost heading to college. You don’t think you will ever see her again after this final year, though you would really like to. 

You still have a soft spot for her. You still get that excitement from getting a message from her maybe once a month. You still try to search her face in a crowd full of faces. And you still feel a hint of jealousy when she talks to that guy she shares classes with. 

But you are content. Those feelings are buried deep in your heart. 

You wish them only luck and happiness, while you try to find yours.",actuallesbians,1579910655,hoi411,,1,True,2020-01-24

4416,"I am drunk and I miss my wife, despite I have a new girlfriend.","
I lost her years ago. She died at an unacceptable age. But I still love her. I will never stop loving her.

I had a lot of women after her, but nobody is like her. 

My wife was kind, reassuring, affectionate, trustworthy, devoted. A pure lady, despite her young age. 

She was my refuge, my salvation. Her kindness, her sweetness, her patience, made her a human masterpiece. She was the light, I am the darkness. The tormented one, full of passion and thirsty of adrenaline.

And I jumped into the hell again, after her death.

I am tormented. She was the only one that would have calm my bad temper, giving me positivity and love.

I want her. I want to make love with her. To fill her, deeply, inside her body, as I filled deeply her heart with all my love.

Now, I am fucking drunk and I feel like shit. I have the hell inside me. I am the devil, who hates their own hell.

I had other womer after her. 

Recently I broke up with a narcissistic girl who wanted to imitate her (the second time it happens, also my other ex wanted to do so) and I also discovered she was having an affair with a guy in the meanwhile, and this guy wasnt aware of that. He broke up with her too, after we both knew her betrayal against us.

Now, I am with this new girl. She is nice, sex is cool, everything seems ok.

But.

Why am I not satified?

Sex is so ordinary. Normal.

With my wife, it was a mistical experience. Pure pleasure, pure love. Her orgasms (yes, I managed  to make her often feel more than one) gave me an amazing satisfaction, like when you give a gift to a Goddess on her altar.

She was my Goddess. 

I do not feel this anymore. With anyone.

And I, while drunk, am thinking I should tell my girlfriend about that. She knows nothing about all this.

My girlfriend and I (both cis late 20s) recently decided to try a strap on...first time was all kinds of awkward. Thrusting is weird for someone who has never had a penis, and we had some issues with her feeling anything or getting much length inserted. She’s 5”2 and 250 pounds, so she has a bit of a tummy, I’m 5”3 and 160 so I’m not all that thin either. We got a beginner 5” dildo/harness combo from lovehoney because neither of us have ever tried one before. We tried missionary and her on all 4s. Missionary was a no go but all 4s helped a bit. But even on all 4s we ran into the same problem of there not being enough inserted. 

Has anyone had this problem before? Do we need to go longer (not wider) if she wants to feel more? Or perhaps my thrusts are too shallow and longer will end up hitting her cervix? TIA",actuallesbians,1579914198,fuckinyikesmydude,,1,True,2020-01-24

Five months in, I told her I loved her, and when I did, she said we'd been in love for a while but were too scared to say anything. That was painfully accurate. At this point, I am over at her house at least 4-5 times a week, I often cook her dinner and breakfast, and I have a copy of her key. She'll usually leave for work before me, so I clean up a bit and let her dog out before I leave.

My lease is up at the end of March, and that's 2 weeks shy of our year anniversary. I have talked to her about my lease being up soon, and me stressing about finding a place, but I haven't directly asked if she'd like to live together. I would honestly like to, it just seems to make sense as I'm already at her place more than mine. Since she's in a one bedroom by herself, I could help her save money by splitting rent and utilities. I also understand she might not be ready for this, and that's completely fine, and would not push it and I would respect her feelings on the matter. I just don't know if I should ask her. Part of me doesn't want to mess things up by moving to fast, but I also feel like I'll never know unless I ask. She's honestly great at communicating, and I don't think I would ruin it by asking, but part of me is still terrified. 

I guess I'm just looking for input. When did you ladies move in with your ladies? How soon is too soon? I know there's not one blanket time frame for anyone, but is it rushing it? I know the trope is that lesbians move really fast, but so far we haven't, and I don't want to mess this up. How should I approach this?

4448,im being black balled,"So ive been with my fiance for about 4 months (ive known her a year). Shes always been super SUPER close to her friends. In our town she has  a group of 3 friends that are all very close. She was always the friend they knew they could call at anytime and she would drop everything to hang out with them or help them or whatever.

Shes always close with her mom and siblings who live in another state. 

Ive met her dad because he lives near us and ive video chatted with the rest of her family.  

Everything was going great.

About two months ago, her BEST friend (who she very briefly dated) said some very nasty things to me and as a result, my fiance stopped talking to her as much and completely stopped hanging out with her. 

Around that time there was a party with the entire group (except the best friend) and things got out of hand with a couple there and everyone was drunk and it resulted in everyone taking a break from hanging out. 

Again, this was fine. 

At Christmas my fiance was going to her moms for a week and i was going to tag along. At the last minute we were told i couldn't come because there was no extra room.  This was okay. I understood. 

The next day get a nasty msg from her brother basically saying i wasnt good enough for her.  This is out of the blue, as up until the point her family and I got along. Her motherhad even sent me several Christmas gifts. 

My fiance ended up coming home four days early because of things her family was saying about me..

Regrettably, i ended up fighting with her family and things escalated to a point where she stopped speaking to them. 


Well last week her mom had texted her yelling at her about how i was controlling her and saying several things about our life that, while not entirely accurate, she couldn't have possibly known.  

Turns out her best friend, who has never met or spoken to my finaces mother before, found her on Facebook in December and msged her telling her all
About our relationship, most of which wasnt true, and in return they reached out to my fiances other friends that dont live near us and since December have apparently been trying to basically pull an intervention.

A few days ago we found all info out and my fiance went off on the friend and then I also went off on her and told both her and my fiance that they were no longer allowed to be friends, that this friend no longer existed. My fiance is very forgiving and has no backbone and people walk all over her. I love that she is so loving and forgiving but she never stands up for herself.  

She actually agreed that she didnt want this person in her life anymore. 

Now everyone is trying to get her to leave me, talking behind our backs and saying im emotionally abusive and controlling and that ive been manipulating her for months.  

Its really frustrating because im the one who has been trying to get her to maintain her friendships since weve been together first of all, and also i am coming out of an emotionally and physically abusive relationship myself.  

Ive tried so hard to make sure she has all her relationships in tact, yet im blamed for them falling apart. No matter how many times she tells everyone she just likes being home with her family (i have kids she now claims as her own), noone listens. They think I'm making her say that. 


So now shes losing all her friends and family because of me and i legitimately feel so awful about it. I know its killing her.

4450,My girlfriend is going through stuff and I don’t know what to do.,"This is gonna be pretty unorganized because, one, I’m on mobile, and two, I haven’t really let myself process this fully because it’s intimidating and I’ve been busy enough to distract myself from going through everything mentally.

My girlfriend (of 2 years, also long distance) has been having a really tough time lately (maybe the last month or so), after a really difficult autumn. She had to switch antidepressants recently and her family situation has been getting more and more unstable. She has some really big life decisions she needs to make by summer and is also dealing with thoughts, urges, and habits from her past that endangered her safety. I can’t even imagine how horrible she’s feeling right now, but I’m trying to be there for her.

The problem is that it feels like she doesn’t want me to be there for her. Where we would usually message/talk throughout the day, she’s mostly silent until right before bed or early in the morning, and those interactions feel stiff and completely lacking of emotion. I feel like she’s annoyed with every interaction and I end up feeling guilty for bothering her. And I think I’m getting more and more scared of her saying “I don’t feel a connection between us anymore,” but god I’m really trying to keep that connection. She doesn’t want to talk about what’s stressing her out, and it feels like she doesn’t want to talk about anything else.

She’s everything to me. We hoped to move in together in a few months. I feel lost and hopeless at the thought of being without her. And I miss her so so much. I feel like my days are so less rich and enjoyable without at least sharing things with her and being there to listen to her. I miss her calling me in the evenings on her drive home and I’m too scared to call her because there’s a chance she’ll answer and tell me straight up she has nothing to say to me. I miss her so much.

I don’t know where I’m going with this. I don’t know what to do. I don’t want her to cut me out of her life because I know there is hope for her situation to improve and I want to help get her there. But I’m so scared she doesn’t want anything to do with me... I’m even scared that talking about this will make her say “You’re right, let’s just stop dating now to end your pain” even though that’ll just devastate me so much more. 

I don’t know. I wish I could go to her and be there for her even when there aren’t words to be said. I hate being long distance, god.",actuallesbians,1579930498,greshameful,,1,True,2020-01-25

4453,Talking to Girls is Like Really Hard (the troubles with moonlighting),"Ok ladies, you are gonna have to let me know if this happens to you. So I am very much a baby lesbian, with only about a month out of the closet. That being said I flag pretty hard to the point where I don't even have to come out any more and queer girls will either start flirting or start talking about gay things like girl in red ect. It's happened to me enough to the point where I've termed it moonlighting, based off the movie moonlight, when ever 2 queer girls both know they are queer and therefore have to figure out where their relationship stands, either as cool gay best friends or girlfriends. On the surface this dose not seem like that much of a problem but it is for me for two main reasons, 1) I am in a relationship with a girl I've been dating for 2 years and therefore can't become girlfriends with every queer girl I meet and 2) I've been in moonlight before with my now girlfriend for like a year before we started dating and I know how painful ""just friends can be"". So my solution to stay in the queer friend I make has just been to mention my girlfriend as quickly as possible into our friendship so they do not catch feelings and so I don't moonlight them for too long and we can move on with our lives. Anyway I have some pretty great stories revolving this topic that I can share at another time if you guys want but I just had to know if I'm the only one who this happens too.  Sorry for a long post thanks for reading.

4457,Feeling Down - Just Venting,"I like this group the most have found support here when I was feeling low before..and  I know this may not be relevant content - but I found out recently I got passed up for a promotion while those junior to me received one bc of their connection the manager. 

It sucks bc I absolutely hate the 'teachers pet' and sucking up games...but I'm starting to see a new side of corporate. That particular manager leads all the teams in my department and she's big on favoritism and very obvious about it. She's my managers manager so I dont report directly to her. However, the manager I report to is new and clearly doesn't  me well enough yet - so he took her words into consideration and copy and pasted word for word a few sentences I received from last years review (which was a glowing review from my old manager who was so awesome and  invested in my career) and then put a negative spin on it. I knew this was unfair because I did work hard and he gave me bs feedback about how I should be ""asking clients more about how their day was, finding out their hobbies"" and it sucks because I'm in a position where I fought back but nothing was done about it....he even ended with lets call it what it is - I might be too new to have rated you. At this point I just want to leave the company because it's unfair when you get passed up for a promotion you deserved - especially when the guy who gets it is always chatting with his friends online or in the cafeteria (i have a clear view of his desk screen, and when I go to grab coffee I see him and his friends all sitting down and chatting - which is okay during break hours but I see him frequently during working hours). I know the last piece wasnt necessary, he's a nice guy but the knowledge of knowing he got promoted and you didn't makes you bitter towards him, my manager (1000% realized he's actually a douche) and his manager who has turned this team into a popularity contest - there are several other reasons that point to this that are not related to my situation only.",actuallesbians,1579934496,JustTrynaVentYo,,1,True,2020-01-25

4462,"I don’t know if I belong here, but hi","I’ve been going through a lot of therapy and healing lately, and I feel like I’m discovering who I really am. I was raised in a really toxic environment where I was heavily discouraged from exploring my independence and individuality. Now that I’m finally healing, I’ve been thinking lately that I might be bisexual. I really don’t know though. 

I don’t know why I think I’m bisexual. I’ve never had romantic feelings for a woman. I’ve only ever dated men. I find women sexually attractive, but the thought of actually having sex with a woman is scary, and honestly a little gross to me. But then again, the concept of touching a random penis is gross too, so idk. 

My whole life, I have had problems connecting with and trusting other women due to having a toxic mom. Maybe that’s the reason I’ve never really had female crushes? Or maybe I haven’t had female crushes because I’m not really bisexual, and I’m just confused.

I decided to make this post because my boyfriend and I just broke up. I haven’t been single in years. I’m not ready to start dating right away, but I’ll have to start again eventually. A part of me wants to ‘experiment’ with a woman, romantically or sexually, but I’m just too scared and confused. What if I’m wrong? 

I’m sorry that this is so long. And I’m sorry if I’m posting in a space where I don’t belong. I’ve been going through so much lately. Maybe I’m discovering my real self, or maybe I’m just grasping at straws in my pain and confusion.

4477,Marrying your best friend,"Growing up i always got the advice that i should look out for a kind guy or a polite one and not focus on looks when looking for a partner. Character was more important.

A lot of movies or shows talk about marrying your best friend. I took it quite literally. I've only had one boyfriend. I shared a lot of common things with him but i ignored the voice in my head which told me that i was not attracted to him. I liked him but looking back i wasn't into him romantically. I just assumed it would develop automatically if i stayed long enough. I forced myself to feel because he was such a good guy. I mean all the stories i heard from my peers about assholes they'd date and i thanked God i  had such a sweet person in my life.

A year after we broke up i met this girl who just gave me butterflies whenever i looked at her. Nothing about her bored me. I knew her only for 3 months but just about anything she did i loved it. I mean she sang the same song on a loop for 3 freaking months and I could listen to her sing her heart out. I never told her how i felt.

It's been 3 years since then and I don't really remember her face anymore but she taught me about attraction and that was the first time i realised how i experienced it because I'd assumed i wasn't someone who was very sexual. It honestly feels so good to be out to myself and not to suppress how i express and not let the society around me dictate how i should feel.

4481,Spreading some positive vibe for my femme sisters!,"25 year old femme lesbian here. For the longest time I struggled to understand what other lesbians liked about butches, to each their own, no judgement! But my ignorant thought process for a long time was ""But...if I liked that I might as well date a guy right?"" , so when I saw this thread in here talking about why girls like butches I saw it as an opportunity to be open minded and educate myself. As a femme who is into other femmes (though the tough female or gothic look I would never say no to!) I of course couldn't relate to a lot of the stuff that was said, but it did help me understand the butch aesthetic more and what people like about it. 

HOWEVER there was one thing that made me take a step back and go ""hey hey hold on a second people!""  I saw a lot of comments about confidence and how confident butches look/are. There were so many comments about confidence it almost felt like an indirect statement of ""yeah femmes are insecure""  not saying anyone said that or implied that, just the vibe the comments had. So I am here to stand up for my femme sisters and show how confident we are!

Maybe your battle gear is flannels and masculinity but that doesn't mean I don't feel like I could conquer the world in mine. When I put on eye makeup and show a bit of cleavage while looking gay fabulous as hell I feel like I could conquer the whole world in that one night! In the past I did struggle a little, the stereotype in the lesbian community is the butch look, when you look femme you are assumed to be straight. I also go to an engineering university, it often felt weird how the other girls looked so plain/boring like they were saying ""300 guys and only 10 girls? Beggars can't be choosers!"" but eventually I got past that all and was like screw it I am a gay fabulous femme and love it!  

Again no hate or judgement, we all have our own preference and no single preference is 'better' or stuff. Just felt the need to show we femme girls are also hella confident! Again, when I run around in my pretty skirt with makeup and a bit of cleavage it isnt me saying ""please notice insecure me, give me attention""  it is me going ""hey the queen has arrived and she aint afraid to flex her queenly beauty on you all!"".

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Also what might be interesting to hear, since we are talking about the femme aesthetic anyway now. What do others like about femmes? I know my own preferences and wouldnt be surprised if other femmes who like femmes would name the same stuff as me, but girls who are on different parts of the spectrum(butch, dyke, etc.) what do you like about femmes?",actuallesbians,1579959109,BattleSisLaura,,1,True,2020-01-25

4484,Starting to fall for my friend... But she's moving in April.,"Kinda long story. 

I met this girl, D, back in September. We went out 3 times, had a lot of fun, kissed once, and then she went away for a business trip and things kind of fell off. We both got back with our toxic exes, but remained friends through out. We've both since ended things with the exes. 

Last weekend she invited me over to hang out. We got drunk and fell asleep and cuddled all night. She gave me a quick peck on the lips before leaving for work, but that's it. 

A couple of days ago I went over again, we drank a bit, she admitted that she liked me, and this time we made out. A lot. She jokingly said ""you fuckboy you're a good kisser"". We ended up fooling around. 

And it's like, something just switched. Before we were kinda flirty but not over the top, but now it's that we're both showing mutual interest in each other. I love that I can just be my goofy, no filter, dirty mouthed self and she loves it. 

I wasn't really looking for anything and was in the mindset of just focusing on myself and making money. But now I'm finding myself catching feelings for her and she's moving in April to Florida. We live in Pennsylvania. So... Yeah. 

If we continue down this road, I know I'm gonna fall for her. And this will result in either two things. She stays and doesn't move. Or she moves and we're both left hurt. 

She stated ""you have me second guessing moving"" and I told her that she needs to do what's best for her, regardless of me. I don't want to hold her back. She has a couple of reasons why she's moving to Florida and I don't want to keep her from reaching her full potential. 

I'm thinking we can have fun, enjoy each other while we can, and remain friends after she moves and I'll still come and visit her.

For example, one of my closest friends who's stood up for me before sometimes jokes around by saying ""she'll probably be into that"" when our other friend jokingly squeezes my ass or ""she might become attracted to you,"" even though she knows it's not the truth. Another newish friend always makes the ""haha you're all BI-yourself"" joke and it really bothers me. I also don't even identify as bi and sure it may have been funny the first time but it's been that consistent joke since September.

I'm not gonna try defending what my first friend is saying, but albeit wrong, it's the only time she's ever hurtful and I don't think she understands the connotations that come with her trying to be ""funny.""

I have trouble standing up for myself in situations like this so what's the best way to approach her and talk to her about this? What are some of your personal experiences with people saying shitty things and how'd you handle it?",actuallesbians,1579964052,fairlyglass,,1,True,2020-01-25

4492,"I need a hug, I have a husband but I'm gay","Throwaway for obvious reasons. So, this story is long and confusing, but I'll try to make it quick.

My husband and I are trans. We fell in love 9 years ago and planned our whole life out together. I moved halfway across the country to be with him. Things were good, though weird. Then I cracked.

It was a chain reaction of shit. After I cracked my husband cracked, I accepted that my parents abused me, I took a month of medical leave, I started hrt, he started hrt, I got fired, I kept being unemployed, and now this. My life has been in turmoil while also going through puberty and while my husband does as well. Despite all this we're best friends, we do everything together with big ole grins, but stuff still felt wrong.

Before I cracked I thought I was only into women, so when he told me he wanted to transition I had a crisis. I've only ever been attracted to women, but I love him. Maybe he's my exception and it'll be fine. I've tried for months, trying to convince myself, to convince him, and it all came to a head this week. I started feeling more and more on edge around him, fights were coming out of think air, and I just felt so confused.

While this was happening, my brain had been going into puberty for months and I had gotten a lot if crushes. All of the crushes were women, but I just shrugged and thought ""I'm married, doesn't matter much anyways"". That's all fine and good until one of said crushes admits to *me* that she's attracted to me. Don't worry this isn't a homewrecker thing, we both kinda just went ""Fuck"" and have put up a few walls to be like ""worst idea ever"".

This plus the fighting though finally pushed me to accept what I always knew, I'm gay. I get so jealous of lesbian couples, my brain struggles to comprehend it. I feel so dirty, like I led him on. I kept telling him I'm still attracted to him, but it's faded every month on T. I'm just so tired and I don't know where to begin.",actuallesbians,1579965633,LesbianHusband,,1,True,2020-01-25
4493,Second “Date” Dilemma,"So I went on my first date/hangout with a girl a few days ago. Well also it was like my first date in general lol. It was absolutely amazing. She actually mentioned hanging out again at the end of it. So yesterday I went ahead and asked her to do something in a couple days.

Here’s the issue. So I’m in college at the moment and do not have a car. I mainly Uber or catch a ride from friends/family sometimes. She is taking a gap year and is working + has a car. I don’t know what to plan to do? I was gonna suggest like a movie and then we grab food (bc I want to talk more, not just watch a movie lol) but it would be awkward for me to Uber after the movie. Or it would be more awkward, I think, to ride with her? Anyways should I just suggest something where we stay at one location? Any fun suggestions? 

I was also considering like walking around this part of town with shops &amp; stuff? I know there’s a vegan milkshake place &amp; an art gallery (she talked about art when we first hung out).

4494,Useless lesbian at work,"This is so stupid but I need to get this off my chest before I explode. 

So, I’m crushing pretty hard on this girl at work. She’s really cool and nice but we work on different teams so we only ever cross paths in the common areas or at department events. However, when we are in the same vicinity I just can’t bring myself to talk to her or even look at her because I’m worried about looking dumb in front of her or letting her know that I like her. Yeah, stupid and completely counter productive I know, but I just can’t help myself. 

Anyway, I happened to be sharing the same table with her and her friends during lunch last week and I overheard her talking about an interview she had at another company so she’s probably not sticking around for much longer :/ (yes, eavesdropping is bad but they were literally across the bench from me) and when she does leave I don’t even have any guise to “keep in touch”.

4500,"My missed connection, need advice !","So this happened while I was talking a bus with my friend to pick up smth for him. 

My friend pointed out that he really liked the haircut of the girl who was standing kinda in front of us, but we could only see her back. She had old school mullet with shaved sides, so I just looked at her and just really liked her style overall. I still didn't see her face, but then a moment later she turned around a bit and at that point I guess I just started smiling to myself thinking how beautiful she was and she just had such a good energy about her.  

Another moment later she looked at me and our eye contact lasted longer than any usual one would. We were smiling to each other at that point.  

Few seconds later our bus was stopping and she was getting off there with her friend, the same bus stop that we needed to get off as well, they were the first one to get off the bus. 

She actually stood by the bus stop as if waiting for her friend, but she was looking at me and as I was walking out I also kept on looking at her and we even stood right across each other where is our bodies were facing each other, looking and smiling.  She was with her friend and I was with my friend, I just couldn't figure out fast enough the way to talk to her without making it awkward for everyone involved. 

As we needed to go opposite directions my friend just started to walk one way and I followed. 

As we walked I told my friend what just happened and he immediately told me ""let's go let's gooo we can still catch them and you can ask for her number or smth"" and I just brushed it off. 

Only later it kinda hit my like a ton of bricks that the look she gave me with her eyes the second time outside was just her trying to tell me that since I liked her so much and smiling like an idiot it is not a problem If I just approach her in that moment. Because why would she do it if I was the one looking at her and smiling initially. This really does kinda make sense now.   


Its been couple of days now, but I cant stop thinking about her. There is a really good chance that we might come across each other as we live very nearby (assuming she was taking a bus home, which it looked like) and the city we live in is not that big, most people walk around central area as well. 

This is one of the very very few regrets I'll have for some time.

She's stated several times that she doesn't think that line should be referred to as biblical canon since it's in the Old Testament (this line is in Leviticus chapters 18-20, often misinterpreted to say that ALL men should not lay with men, (also, not saying anything about women) for the sake of preserving ""ritual purity"").

Recently she had a meeting with one of the heads of her church, one that condemns homosexuality. I think that the bastard snaked his way into her mind and changed it. When are people going to learn that one, all homosexuality is not explicitly condemned in the Bible, and two, that it's none of their damned business in the first place!

There was definitely some flirting going on, but I'm crap at picking up signals when sober, let alone drunk, so it took me pulling a jenga piece with ""Kiss the person in the room you most want to"" on it for me to stupidly stare at her and go ""I know who that is"" (in far more slurred words). She leaned in and oh my god, it was warm and close and nice; I can still feel it on my lips!

While I know that romantic/sexual milestones are so often heterocentric and lots of queer people don't follow the same path, it felt like that kiss was spitting in the face of the idea that I'm behind or defective in some way. At that moment I felt so validated as a lesbian.

I've recently been doing some scoping out of realistic transition goals for my future transition (I'm trans) and have stumbled onto the fact that a lot of women who identify as butch actually look more masculine than I do even pre transition and it's actually a pretty cool way to express womanhood .   So a more masculine/androgyenous aesthetic might actually be my best bet for passing and I find it appealing to some degree.   So the question is.  Would a bisexual lady dressing/acting in a butch way and possibily callng herself a butch be offensive/approritative?

4510,is it too fast?,"Over a month ago my (now ex) girlfriend decided to break things up with me. There was a lot of negativity building up and now, looking at it from distance, I can tell it started to get unhealthy. After that I struggled a terrible depressive episode but with time I realized that it was best for me that the thing has ended. 

Anyway, around Christmas, once my episode had passed and I was feeling better, I met some other girl. We really just kinda clicked and vibed. I can have open and genuine conversations about anything and everything,  She’s a great listener and manages to help me shift my focus when I need it. Overall I feel much happier and content since we became friends. 

She did, however, state that she has some kind of romantic feelings for me but she is not going to push me into something I might not be ready for just yet. 

She’s usually the one who offers to meet up or hang out on facetime. It feels really nice because in my last relationship I felt like I had to beg my ex to spend time with me. 

All in all I start to feel a certain kinda way about the girl I met in December. She motivated me to make my life a bit better and I can tell she cares about me (she also mentions that when we talk) and I care about her.  

My question is, is it alright for me to develop feelings after two months since my ex dumped me? 

I’ll add that over that time I really focused on self care/love and therapy. I feel much better when I’m on my own as well and generally things are better for me now. I’m just in a better place mentally. I can tell I love myself the way I am.",actuallesbians,1579225918,moriseczek,,1,True,2020-01-16

4516,Is it Ok to Be Excited? Or Did I Mess Up Already?,"So I met this girl irl. We hung out, made out, they were texting me a good amount. That sat, I invited them for food, they suggested bringing it to her place. I said lets eat there and see how we feel. Wound up at her place. We're lying in bed, and she's teasing me about wanting to take me out for a real date. She asks what I'm looking for. I make her answer first. She says she's seeing someone but it's not serious. That she has been having fun and focusing on self improvement since an LTR but is open to a relationship if it comes along. That she'll know it when she sees it. That the other girl is not serious, as I was very unexpected. 

I tell her p similar. That I'm also focused on self improvement, dating, open to a relationship if it comes along or feels right. Then I say something I kind of regret when she brings up the other girl: ""I'm totally cool with that. I just want to date and see how things feel. In the mean time you see your ppl and I'll see mine."" Bc I want to take the pressure off her, and myself in case it doesnt work. We kiss, mess around, start talking again about pace. I try to say something vague about slowness, then decide screw it and say ""hey, i know i can be really misleading bc I'm very physical and then I want to move slow."" She says she likes it. I explain: ""Look, I was assaulted a while back. I'm seeing someone for it, but sometimes it makes things really difficult."" 

She says sorry, we can talk about it, not, or she can hold me. It was kind of a perfect response. We hook up, tho I have to stop a couple times. We cuddle. I leave. I text her a sweet thank you msg, say I want to do it again. Next day she and I text a bit about random stuff. She invites me out Mon. I can't bc of work. Tues, a bit of texting. Wed, we're making weekend plans, or trying to. Later invite her out, she says shes actually going out w friends and invites me. We cuddle the whole time. 

Go up to her place. We're kissing, and she asks me how I am, tells me she wants me to feel safe. I thank her for checking in, say I'm fine, we lie down on her bed, cuddle talk. She asks me about past relationships, dating etc. I explain dated a few ppl for a few months, but they were poly and not my thing, and just generally hard to be open sometimes. She says shes not poly either. We're both happy about it. She talks about vulnerability. I say how I have a soft center behind my exterior. She says ""I know."" Asks about my past exp with guys. I explain how seeing a therapist has been helpful, how an old therapist back in the South (ugh) told me I was only acting gay bc I had been assaulted in the past and how this put me back in the closet. I tell her it's frustrating to have certain barriers but I believe they're getting better. She holds me, we cuddle. 

I leave, she asks me to text her when I'm home. I do, and am pretty smiley and floaty as I say ""thank you for a great night :)"" she texts back ""thank you :)"" I wish her luck w work tomo. She texts back ""sweet dreams"" Today, we didn't text til I shot her a ""Hey! Hope shift is going well"" and a vid. She responds, asks me how my day is going. I text back a comment on her shift being slow, send her a music video to pass the time and then respond a short 1-2 sents on my day. Haven't heard anything back yet though it's only been about 2 hours. 

Basically, part of me is excited. I think there are good signs here. But I worry my first comment on wanting to date may have thrown things off if she was looking for a relationship. But then we had the poly talk, and have talked about personal stuff, and have potential weekend plans, so Idk. I'm trying to just be cool and ride this out, but I'm nervous. Sometimes I feel like she's interviewing me for a potential relationship. She's told me I make her really nervous. She compliments me a lot.

4526,Need to get this out somewhere...,"I literally joined Reddit (after looking for years) just to vent... Warning: this is a super long-winded description of my relationship problems plus being crazy in love with my boss.

I'm in a hell of a bind and not sure what to do--or what I want--yet, find myself moving forward, anyway.

I'm in my 30s, Cis F, jrecently finished grad school and, after living apart for years, finally moved back in with my bf. I needed time to breathe after grad school and my bf, who super generously offered to let me not help with covering his rent (I moved into his apartment), still insisted--quite reasonably--that I start looking for work right away. So, I did a quick search on Craigslist and answered an add for a low paying job at a tiny non-profit that has nothing to do with my degree. I got the job and since then have been settling into a new life with the typical ups and downs that that entails. 

Here's the dilemma:

The good: 

My partner and I have been a couple for years and years. He is incredibly loving and supportive, but is also not controlling or needy or anything. He's always let me do my thing. We've lived a part for a lot of our history and it has been difficult, as you can imagine. It has also been amazing, both because it has allowed us individually to really pursue our passions and also because distance has forced us to really approach our relationship with intention and thoughtfulness. We've had to up our communication game, learn how to fight well, and just generally figure out how to squeeze the most out of limited time together. Now, having spent the last five months actually living together in the same house, sharing the same bed, a lot of the skills we honed while we were physically apart have brought on a new level of intimacy and comfort. 

The bad: 

I, personally, approached our ldr (especially in the hardest moments) with the attitude that my partner was worth waiting for, and there was no point in ending things--unless someone better came along. I'm pansexual and my romantic and sexual inclinations are pretty specific. I couldn't see myself ever doing a dating app, for instance. I doubted that I'd find someone whom I like as much as my bf, so I put up with some pretty behavior from him for much of our time apart. I recongize that this attitude of waiting till someone better came along is problematic, but from a standpoint of pragmatic self-interest, it made perfect sense. It was also just easier to manage while I was in a very intense, stressful, rewarding and soul-consuming grad program--who has the energy to date under such circumstances?

The second bad thing is that my partner has major body issues and, as a result, we have not had sex for years. For the last three years, this was not a big deal for me. I knew sex would be a big challenge once I moved back in with him and would involve a lot of talking and other things (my partner is not American and is not from a culture where this kind of communication is easy), but I figured we would get to it gradually and gently. Still, I did not expect my libido to suddenly come roaring back to life once my diploma finally came in the mail. I also did not expect that, along with increased desire, I would find myself no longer desirous of my partner.

The ugly:

This rinky non-profit job has been just amazing! Unlike grad school and teaching and research, there is literally no way for me to take any part of this job home with me: when I exit the building that's it. My co-workers are amazing and I can't think of a single one who makes me anything less than laughingly happy to see when I get in. The clients of the non-profit are also amazing in many ways--sweet, interesting, with amazing skills and life stories. It is both a non-bs job and a place that just makes me really happy. Because of this job, I've had time to explore my old city, think about my life and myself, and start to get healthy again. But the pay is only sustainable because I don't need to pay rent.  I love this job, but I probably can't stay here forever.

I also love my boss. Typing those words is such a relief! I love her and it is beautiful and overwhelming and has, in the past three weeks, especially, taken over my life. And I decided to just let it. 

The last two years of grad school were incredibly sad and difficult for me, for many reasons that I won't get into. I'm an inherently upbeat person, so even in the midst of depression, I've been lucky enough to still find the world and people around me beautiful, but my own place in things seemed just totally worthless and I felt real despair for the world. It hasn't helped that the city I moved back to has turned into a pit of financial and social inequality that probably hasn't existed in this country for decades. In short, I felt sort of lost and empty and then one day I realized that I had feelings for my boss and it was like all the color came flooding back into my world. So, even as I've wrestled with these feelings, I've also celebrated them because they have filtered into every other aspect of my life and it has been amazing. 

Part of this attitude has been because I had no idea what my boss felt about me--I mean, I've had my hunches that she likes me, but I didn't know for sure. Since we work in a tiny environment and the work we do--especially what she does--is essential for the operation of the entire non-profit, I didn't want to risk causing any problems for her or anybody else I work with. So, I've just been suffering in silence. And I have to say, that I have really suffered! As a pansexual femme who is fairly conventionally attractive, my sexuality has always been pretty passive in the way that our society trains women to be. This means that the majority of my sexual encounters and relationships have been with men who pursued me and whom I found acceptable. As I said, I have a pretty narrow set of attractors and so rarely find myself attracted to anyone, so most of my experience of love has been of someone else finding me desireable and then making a move and I either reject or accept them. I have really only ever experienced anything like unrequited love once before and that was with a person with whom I started a relationship and then he ended withdrawing for a bunch of very valid reasons that had nothing to do with his feelings for me. But I've never had a crush like this on someone and have it be totally one-sided, as it were. I've tried to just be in the moment and sit with these feelings. My whole initial approach was just to watch and see and not do anything, because, how can I?

I'm trying to center myself in the middle of these feelings. I'm also crazy awkward Lesbianing. I'm an introvert in the classic sense of needing alone time, but I've also spent a lot of my life living in very communal situations, so I can be alone with others in the room. I've also spent much of my life living in very different cultural surroundings and I've had to hustle a lot in life. As a result, I'm really good at just talking to people and being friendly. I think most folks at work see me as outgoing, but around my boss I can barely open my mouth. Sometimes I literally start shaking when she enters the room. So, it's been easy to play it cool around her because I can't even fucking have a conversation with her about anything, let alone attempt to flirt with her.

So, I was embracing--or tyring to--this unrequited crush experience. Then Xmas eve, I ended up inviting myself after work to go out for a beer with my boss and a friend of hers who had volunteered that night and with whom I have great platonic friend chemistry. During this little outing the friend did a couple of odd things that changed everything for me: first, my boss went to get beers for us and he and I went to stake out some chairs. He saw three open stools at the bar and had me stand by them. I assumed that the two of them being old friends, they'd want to sit next to each other, so I put my bag on the last seat, but G said, ""Don't you think you should sit in the middle?"" and just picked up my bag and put it there. Then, afterwords, G and I were to head south on the same mass transit device while my boss traveled north. However, at the last minute G suggested that we ride with my boss for two stops on her route and then transfer to a different mass transit device. No reason to do this, and in fact a couple of bucks more expensive than our original route. When the three of us got on the vehicle, G initially sat next to my boss on one side, so that I had to sit next to her on the other side. As soon as I did so, G got up and moved across the aisle. 

To me, it seemed clear that G was awkwardly trying to engineer situations where my boss and I would be sitting next to each other. Of course, my gay brain exploded at this and I became convinced that what must have happened was that my boss has been secretly in love with ME and feeling just as awkward and shy around me as I have around her, and then going out with G and spilling her guts and the details of her love for me to him. 

So, fast forward to New Year's Eve. The three of us are all working again and I have dressed as nice as I possibly can for this job and show up at work and tell folks that I'm open to going out after. I just about throw up/cream my pants (sorry) when another co-worker who is also great friends with my boss comes up to me and invites me to go out with her--and my boss! Fuck yeah! Shit is happening, right? Forget the bf, forget work ethics...I'm totally going to make out with my boss at new year's. 

Or, not. At the end of the night, the co-worker (not my boss) comes up and tells me that my boss has changed her mind and is tired and that she is also kind of tired. She then asks me something about my boyfriend. G happens to still be around, though, so I just grab him and go out with him. We get along really well, so why not? 

Anyway, the two of us end up spending a lot of money and drinking too much. I do my best to push my boss to the back of my mind. I waver between thinking that maybe what happened was she freaked out when her friend essentially set up a date with me for her and that's why she backed out--but she freaked out because she's crazy about me--and feeling like the more realistic scenario is that she was legitimately tired and doesn't actually give a shit about me beyond me just being a person she works with. My mind is a mess and G and I are engaged in a crazy conversation and the drinks are good and the night goes on like that and with each passing minute, I feel like a little bit of me is just dying. 

And then G says, ""Yeah, I've heard a LOT about you."" And of course, I know who he must've heard about me from. Still, I ask him what he means: who's talking about me? He just shakes his head and says he can't say, which only confirms for me my wildest, dearest suspicions that my boss has been going on about me to him because she is head over heels in love with me. 

Now, the evening has taken a turn and the path before me seems suddenly obvious. Another drink and I just go for it. I think I actually moaned and hit the bar with my fists as I said something like, ""God damn it! I really like X!"" G does a better job not spilling his guts this time, but tells me that if I'm interested, I should ""take it outside of work"" and invite her out. Which is just such genius advice.

The next morning, as I cower beneath my covers under the weight of a hangover anxiety attack--next to my sleeping bf, I might add--I send her a text asking her if I can ""pay her back"" the beer she bought me on Xmas. Five hours later she responds asking for a raincheck.

&amp;#x200B;

And that's it. Things have been awkward as hell, but still professional at work. A week and a half ago, she just tells me that I can leave a half hour early. I'm kind of devastated, partly because I'd gotten there hours before her and had spent the whole time psyching myself up for the moment when she would walk in, such that I actually jumped when she appeared. And then I'd taken all of my energy and focus to try and keep calm around her and finally--finally!--I'd settled into a comfortable silence and was now actually savoring being near her and just watching and feeling her from a distance as we went about our work. And her she was teling me to buzz off. I don't think I said anything. I just grabbed my shit, clocked out, and ran out. As I was half way out the door, I heard her say, ""I'll be up for that beer later this week."" You can imagine how I felt--I walked halfway home just smiling insanely. I felt like I was tripping on mushrooms. It was amazing. And...that's it. Literally nothing.

I actually worked up the courage last Saturday to ask about that beer, but she demurred. I'm proud of myself for doing it. I go back and forth between wanting to write some of my feelings about her in a letter and then deciding I've already made myself clear and I need to not be creepy (this post is a compromise), but now I'm trying to prepare for an eventuality that this is it. Nothing will come of this. I still have a lot of hope about it, so even as I say out loud (well, just to myself, I guess) that things aren't going to work out, that She Doesn't Like Me (or, a more flattering version: she does like me, but the baggage with the boyfriend and being a co-worker is too much for her), I know I'm not actually moving on.

I go into work with just her tomorrow and Sunday. I'm still crazy excited for this. In spite of the awkwardness and looming heart break, I still feel amazing every single time I look up and see her--or hear her voice in another room. She makes me insanely happy and I love her even though I don't really know her and probably never will.

There's this girl who I've known for about six months now and the interactions have left me confused. So a bit of backstory:
We know each other as classmates and the first thing she ever said to me was ""Oh my god, I've wanted to talk to you the second saw you. I felt some sort of pull or bond between us immediately and I don't know why."" and I kid you not, within 3 days of knowing each other she's told me her whole life story, mental health, family life and all (she also told me that she's questioning). In the span of a couple of months, we became really really close. I would be the only person she'll hang out with in my class. On Oct. 30, (we met in the beginning August so thats about 3 months of knowing each other and yes, I remember that day vividly) my friends and I went to the movies together and she tagged along. Throughout the whole movie, she gradually got closer and closer to me to the point where our heads were touching. She also held my hand at random times. And ever since that day, the interactions got real different. Well, at least for me. We would sit beside each other in class and she'd hold my hand. She would send me memes about two girls liking each other but not making a move  (how ironic). At this point, she told me that she's pretty sure that she's bi. And she did all that knowing I'm gay. Is there something there?

Other things that I didn't mention:
1. Everytime we would spend hours and hours of talking, she would always say that she doesn't notice because she always enjoys talking to me.
2. We once spent 5 hours in the mall just talking bc we missed the movie.
3. Her mom talked to me on the phone saying that she's so thankful for me (bc i'm basically her daughter's emotional support and would take care of her in school) and that she's so excited to meet me because she talks about me A LOT.

I've also done some things haha:
1. I would sometimes hold her hand first bc im a touch starved dumbass 17 year old lesbian who just wants affection too.
2. I gave her expensive ass gifts bc I enjoy spoiling her even though I'm broke af.
3. I would bake for her and pay for her food.
4. I skipped a couple of classes just hugging her because she wasn't doing okay.
5. I asked her if she sees herself being in a relationship with a girl and her response was ""Yeah but I don't see myself making the first move.""

4552,Not sure if this belongs here but I need some advice.,"I'm just gonna make this short. So since the beginning of December 2019, I've had my eye on this girl at work.  I think she's super cute but we can never work together because we work in different areas so I just see her in the halls. I've never had a conversation with her. 

So I decided to look her up on social media... My mistake. I'd like to start off by saying I usually look people up when I'm interested in them (is this weird?) Anyways I messed up and like like 4 of her retweets. I did not know that if you liked retweets the person who retweeted it got notified. So you see where this is going. 

I'm also a very bored/extra person and tweeted some dramatic tweets about how she's an angel and what not. I also stupidly made a video of me talking about her (I basically said hi to her when we walked past and was overly proud of myself lol). Anyways I guess she found out. I've since deleted all the tweets I had about her and what not. 

My problem is everyone is like staring at me. They all know about it. They all probably think I'm super weird (I agree but are we gonna act like I'm the only person in the world who looks people up?) I'm sure they've done it. Now I think I ruined any chances I may have had because I did something stupid and weird. I also think I ruined any potential friendships with anyone. 

She has said a  few words to me since this. I'm not sure if she was being passive aggressive or if I'm just over reacting. If you want the full ""conversation"" dm me. it was only a few words. I don't know I wish I didn't do that.",actuallesbians,1579262994,Sensitive_Study,,1,True,2020-01-17

I went to pee, and this woman was kind of looking at me while I washed my hands. To be fair, we were next to each other. 

Anyway she wants to get to the paper towels and need to reach past me so I say ‘oh sorry!’ Somehow this turns into a ten minute conversation. 

I turn to her, after the towel thing, and wow, she’s...perfect. She’s utterly beautiful. I am awkward because I am not currently at my best (just pulled myself out of homelessness, need a haircut, need better clothes). 

Anyway we chat for ten minutes. She asks me to guess her accent. She tells me about her family. We both live in the same suburb. It’s weird? I don’t usually talk to people in bathrooms. 

She asks if she can give me her number and takes my phone and types it, and gives me her name. She says (she’s Italian) that I could teach her English (I mean, she was already sounding good to me) and she could teach me Italian (I told her I was learning but very bad). 

We walk out together and she introduces me to her roommates at her table who are clearly confused as to wtf is happening. 

Anyway, I text her. I figure she probably gave me a fake number or was drunk because she was...like I can’t convey...beautiful. But it’s her real number. She sent me a love heart? A red one? 

I invited her to hang out with me an a friend tomorrow night for dinner which...I don’t know if that was weird but it was under the guise of ‘meet some more locals’.

***Meet Me In The Middle***

A month or so goes by without us speaking much of anything to each other. I end up barely being on cord either because I find it  difficult to make friends since most of the active users had known each other from a previous chat. Adding on the fact that I busy myself pretending to be studying for my boards. So we end up speaking only a few times between March and April. Once about music and tv shows, both noticing how much our tastes are surprisingly similar and I can quickly feel how easy it is to talk to her. But there were also times when I wondered what she was up to. I had noticed that after I answered question from other users, she’d come in asking the same question right after. Such as the night when cord was planning on streaming a show and a bunch of us were saying how we wouldn’t be able to watch because it was late. Yet she had specifically called me out asking whether I would be joining or not. Or the time when we were posting our selfies and then deleting them after a few people online saw. She noticed I had done that too and actually freaked out spamming the chat with my username because she had missed it. I pretended like I wasn’t online for a bit because frankly, I didn’t know how to react to her reaction. I also didn’t understand why she was only asking for my picture when a lot of other users had deleted theirs too. She also asked if I saw her picture, which I did, she’s stunning. All these little moments started adding up and it became clearer that her attention was on me and she wanted to get to know me more now. But why? What changed between when we first met and now? I was very confused. But either way, I knew I was happy about it. 

We began acknowledging each other mutually and became friends in my opinion. I also started paying more attention to her. I had always been observant so I ended up noticing a lot more about her during this time. Like how playful she is under that blunt surface or how obvious her emotions became to me even though she wasn't explicit about them and always hid more serious feelings like anger/sadness behind her trolling. The latter would end up being a game changer for us in May.",actuallesbians,1579264741,caramel_gnash,,1,True,2020-01-17

Well anyways, I came out of a short relationship (2-3 months ago and about 3 weeks long) with my ""best friend"" (male) that I've known for three years. The reason why we broke up (well I broke up with him) was that my feelings almost vanished the moment I got together with him. 

The thing is, I have a feeling that it's going to be the same with her if we actually become official and I don't want to hurt her.
I have moments where I'm like ""hmm...I would really like to make her mine"" and then I have moments where I'm like ""maybe it's better to stay single"". 

Aahhhh I don't knowwww and I'm honestly freaking out. Tomorrow is a ball that we're both going to and I wanted to ask her there but I don't know if this is gonna be a long-term relationship.....

Sinopsis

Waking up in New York, radiant …blue eyes, what sapphires; lovely smile... deep magnetism. Immersed in her spell, Sheryl has found a treasure; in her soul a small flame has ignited; a fragmented soul, lost, controlled by that unattainable search, to suppress from her life the unwanted unhappiness, product of pain, after such bitter rejection, before her felt attraction for women. She shatters, every day, her being, among excesses, drugs and alcohol; Forgetfulness, her refuge. She has found, without even recognizing it, a ray of hope inside her. Rachel, a reflection of Venus, emanates passion, tenderness, wisdom, empathy for those vulnerable; behind it, a being is hidden, dominated by her fears, repressed by the great and lethal social prejudices.

In an attempt to recover the desired attention; in a quest to fill their souls with light, the magic of music and dance finds them again. Rachel is amazed by the sensuality that Sheryl springs in each movement. The aroma of a coffee accompanies the first flashes of freedom. Sheryl gives Rachel the first great lessons: To love who one is, to be and to ignore social prejudices. And she teaches her that, there is no age limit to be happy, to do what she likes, to fill the heart.

Two beings, two ways of loving life, meeting to be one; teaching themselves about love, freedom and passion; a reverence for love, a tribute to life itself, respect for the human being, to evolve together, to achieve the impossible and to give the universe their legacy of love.

A powerful love story of 2 great beings; which has emanated from the being’s depths, admiration and respect for diversity. A demonstration that love and faith, in themselves and in others, can do everything.

aphrodite, 
bend athena's

kiss her

harm not
a hair of her
head nor
give her 
cause to be

send me such a woman

Weirdly enough, time flew by so quickly. We usually have 45 minutes for lunch but it felt like 10 minutes. She had her hands cupped around her face most of the time, like how you would lean on the table with your hands cradling your face? And she seemed as if she was gazing, I don't know... I can't explain.

Anyhow, they said the eyes are the biggest tellers about someone's feelings and I really do feel like she's into me but is hesitating cos she doesn't know if I'm gay or not.

And then she was blushing when I moved closer and was telling her about how I felt about my ex and what happened and she looked as if she was intently listening. I don't know, I felt my heart was melting but is this normal between girls?

Sometimes, I can't tell if this is how girls who are just friends with each other do. And I'm also not sure if I'm putting meaning into her, what otherwise would be, normal actions, because I like her... Why is liking a girl so much harder than liking guys??

Also, she told me how ""She doesn't really like boys."" Is that a sign? Is she giving me hints? Then she was asking if my mum would mind/have a say in who I date but I said, I don't think it really matters.

What is this?? I'm so confused. Is she just leading me on?

4597,I’m so confused,"I’ve known for several years now that I’m attracted to women and have considered myself bisexual for several years as well. For the past year, I was dating a wonderful guy. We really clicked on an emotional level, and I really feel like I love him on some level. However, sex and physical intimacy in that relationship is really messing me up because I feel like I may not be bisexual after all, I might just be gay. 

There were lots of times I felt I was having sex because it was “the right thing to do” for the relationship or because he wanted to. Sometimes I did genuinely enjoy it! But it was sort of in the same way that I genuinely enjoyed getting myself off with the shower head in high school...it wasn’t really about him, I didn’t really find him to be a turn on. Usually I was thinking about other things or just waiting for it to be over. I thought I couldn’t be a lesbian because we were dating and I was enjoying at least some of the sex, but we recently broke up and I started reflecting on the relationship and I’ve started to feel really apprehensive that I just might be gay. 

This isn’t the first relationship with a sexual component with a guy where the guy itself isn’t doing it for me, but I feel like if I just keep trying enough I’ll be sexually attracted to him. If the sex was good, it was because I was on top and just doing what I wanted and more or less, uh kind of ignoring the other person. And I feel really conflicted and sort of guilty about this. 

I don’t come from an environment where being gay is that accepted, so I kind of always felt anxious about my sexuality, and I really didn’t want to have to face the fact that I might be gay, and as long as we were dating I didn’t have to. But now that I’m seriously reflecting on things, I’m just so confused and feeling pulled in multiple directions. I do love my ex, but I’m starting to feel like it’s not really the sexual/romantic love that I *should* have been feeling. I honestly don’t know what to do, or how to identify, or how to move forward.",actuallesbians,1579291872,abigailrose16,,1,True,2020-01-17

Anyway we left the restaurant she was asking what I was going to do the rest of the day and I said idk. Was it poltiness, an interest or wanting to hang out more idk. I'm reading too much into it probably. She said she was probably going to go home before work.

And she said nice to meet you and I said nice to meet you as well. Thanks for having breakfast with me and I''ll talk to you later. Then we walked off in different directions.

By this I mean, it’s pretty common knowledge that guys undress women in their heads or have sexual thoughts when looking at a pair of boobs.

This guy my mom is dating suddenly SCOFFED, and complained saying why do those type of things need to be in the media and that the biggest problem was that KIDS ARE GETTING EXPOSED TO IT and that he made it seem as if scenes between two humans loving each other are wrong and brainwashing them to being gay. 

I was just flabbergasted. SHOCKED.

It's like I've been living in a bubble, thinking because of how far LGBTQ+ community has come, homophobia still exists. It's scary.

I don't think I'll ever forget the disgust that he showed over a scene between two men in love that wasn't even a minute long.

It's just crazy to think that people such as this dude have such black&amp;white views about things. Hpw boring must their lives be to not be open to the idea that love is not defined by gender.

4611,L-Word rant (first time watcher),"I’ve been watching The L-word for the first time and I’m halfway trough season 5 now and I’m so confused. It’s like they ran out of material after season 3 and just kept going. I really liked season 1-3, but yeah...what was up with season 4. Especially the first half of it was like they just told everyone on set to just do something while the cameras were rolling. 

I hated Jenny in the first season but in season 2+3 she was the person I liked the most and I thought her character development made sense but then season 4 starts and she’s an entirely new person?? season 5 Jenny is even WEIRDER. Shane as well. What’s up with her?lt feels like she’s only there to provide us with sex scenes (I feel so ungrateful complaining and I’m very much into her but her entire story line is just her being naked and fuck every woman she sees and then getting in trouble for it??)
When she was looking at this house with her girlfriend and then cheated at her - it made no sense at all, it was so obvious they just wanted to show two naked women. 

And then they randomly threw in two WOC, and even without having seen anything about it, I just know they must have gotten criticized about the lack of diversity in their cast lol.

And what was up with Helena? Did they just make up a new character each time she was on screen? 

Don’t get me wrong, I am still watching it and I know it must have been groundbreaking when it originally aired, and I’m grateful that a show about lesbians even exists because I haven’t found anything else like that yet and I know that it was a different time so I’m trying to ignore the very problematic things they say and do all the time (especially the scenes with Max...wtf is going on there?) but I needed to rant about this at least once, sorry!!!

Going back to season 5 now. They’re at a party and Shane is in trouble for having sex with someone she shouldn’t have sex with it. Jenny is weird and arrogant and Bette and Tina are fighting.

4613,So apparently I'm pansexual? (A lost redditor story),"So some how I stumbled onto this sub. 
(Btw, y'alls meme game is on point)

To be honest, I haven't had much exposure to the lgbtqia(I think I got that right) community. I grew up in New England in a very progressive area, and was always raised to just be nice to people. There's all kinds of folk out there and it's just easier to be nice. But as far as the community goes, I've never really spent a lot of time with anyone that identifies as anything but straight. Well, that I'm aware of. 

Anyway, long story short, after reading through a bunch of posts, and some googling, as it turns out I'm pansexual and never really had the vocabulary for it. I could go into how I've always had jobs that appeal to the hypermasculine tropes, or my hypermasculine role models, but it really comes down to exposure and vocabulary.

Y'all are so supportive, and willing to explain things to people, so I was able to learn a lot reading through the posts here. 

Anyway, I'll stop invading here. I just wanted to take a hot second to say thank you. I doubt it was your intent, but just by being supportive and informative you managed to help a 34 year old construction worker turned security guard figure some stuff out. I still have a lot to process but a lot of stuff makes sense now, and its oddly liberating to have the vocabulary for something I didn't have before. And to understand a chunk of who I am that for some reason my mind just kinda sliiiiid past without contemplating.

There was no great revelation or change in relationship status... It just sort of happened as a result of something else and it makes it feel... less. Fake. Collateral. Unearned. Like lesbian spaces aren't really *for* me. A major piece of solidarity is just straight up missing. I feel my ""place"" is fighting for **trans** rights, and on the sidelines as an ally or bystander for lesbian rights. Like if I try to vocalize for lesbian rights, it runs the risk of cheapening the entire position from the start and increases the fear that I'll be targeted by transphobia from within... I married a lesbian as my true self; I pass as a woman; I *am* a woman; I deal with the same bigotry and homophobia... but I can't shake feeling like a visitor. It's messing with my head.

4653,STRAIGHT GIRLS,"Uh oh stupid vent pls don't read or do idc but it's LONG!!!

So... straight girls. Enough said, right? I have a straight best friend that I've known for years and have been in love with for a good majority of the time. For the sake of privacy we'll just call her Cindy.

I've been out to her the whole time I knew her, but I only just VERY recently confessed my feelings for her, maybe a month and a handful of weeks ago. Her reaction was... strange. I expected something bad, like her being disgusted and not talking to me again, but I was pleasantly surprised?

She came over to my house a day or two after and told me how she was curious, y'know, about the same gender, and that she would like to maybe take me out on a date in the future. I told her to STOP PLAYING with me but she was being genuinely serious???

Now, I confessed to her at the time that I did for a reason. She had recently broken up with her boyfriend of almost 3 years, meaning that she was in a relationship and therefore unavailable for a good majority of our friendship, (this, however, never stopped her from kissing me. on the lips. multiple times.) but she told me a couple days before that she was going on a date with a boy and I freaked out. Immediate thought was 'wow, after nearly three years of being completely off the market, she's already going on a date with someone new?' I knew I had to strike while the iron was hot. Which... I knew was an unfair position to put her in, but I did anyways, and the date was miraculously cancelled the next time we spoke.

However, there was this girl that I saw everyday in the halls at school... she was beautiful, the perfect goth gf of my dream, and I thought that she could maybe be the next best thing behind Cindy.

I know, that seems like a kinda fucked up thought, but my brain was so rattled with thoughts of being so DESPERATELY infatuated with Cindy that thoughts of almost all other girls revolved around Cindy in one way or another. I'll call the new girl Chloe.

I obviously didn't want to even attempt to pursue anything with Chloe until I knew that my chances with Cindy were null and void, so I waited. The reason that Cindy left me high and dry was because, you know, after her not-so-pretty breakup, she wanted time to heal. Which I totally understood and respected, but it was really beginning to strain on me. I began to get more and more desperate for SOMETHING after never being accepted nor rejected.

On day, I was hanging out with a friend. We'll call her Janice. Janice knew about my feelings and we naturally talked about Cindy, how it was going, and I vented all my frustrations and feelings. Janice had her last class of the day with Cindy, and told me that Cindy had BOASTED to her about how straight she was, or... something like that. The details are fuzzy, but basically she told Janice that she was sure she was straight and continued to leave me hanging, which just pissed me off.

I asked her over text if she was really being serious about questioning her sexuality. Her response was given hours later, and all she had to say was ""where did you get that idea from?"" I asked if that confirmed that she really was just straight, but... no response.

I was livid. I was tired of the games, tired of being strung along, tired of being heartbroken, so I ignored Cindy and shot my shot with Chloe. Out of desperation? Out of pettiness? Out of genuine interest? I don't know. Likely a mix of all three.

But!! I went on a date with her! And I found that she was really interesting and nice and cute and funny and she had an adorable laugh... I liked her. I definitely couldn't say that I was in love with her of course, or that I felt as strongly for her as Cindy, but I think there was something there.

However, I was starting to miss Cindy. I had been dodging her calls and texts for a while, but finally I decided to pick up one time and we arranged to talk the next day. There was a lot of crying, emotions, talking, but we both decided to put everything behind us and we made up.

Now I'm just torn. I'm still so painfully in love with her and she keeps fake flirting with me which just makes it worse. But I have Chloe to take into consideration, and while we're not officially a thing (she actually said to me the other day that we felt more like ""friends"" which seemed like a subtle friend zone...? But I dunno, she said that wasn't the case I think?) I would hate to cut things off with her.

4655,Good people in this world!,"I just wanted to share a lovely experience that my wife and I had a while back. We got married this past August, but prior to that during the wedding planning phase, we had an in person meeting with our officiant. We met at a local cafe, and the crowd there was on average a bit older, and I could feel a woman at the next table over staring at us after we had been sat for a while and were very clearly talking about our wedding (this lady was within earshot). To be honest, I had automatically assumed that this elderly woman was staring at us because she was judging us and was uncomfortable with the fact that we are a lesbian couple. But after our meeting was over and the officiant left, this woman walked up to us and said “excuse me...I just wanted to wish you two a happy life together.” I was floored. I practically started tearing up I was so touched. It was just a really nice reminder that there are some wonderful and kind people in this world and I wanted to share it with y’all. I also acknowledge that my wife and I have the absolute privilege of living in a country (Canada) where we can get legally married, and that we live in a large urban city (Vancouver) where people *tend* to be more progressive.

It started off really well? Like really cute intimate bar, she said she wanted to know everything about me. We talked about literally everything. Dreams. Travels. Family. Future. Favourite books and movies. 

And our hands keep touching and I’m thinking ‘wow this is so great, we can talk so easily’. 

Anyway we get a second round of drinks, probably spend three hours together. 

Towards the end I steer it towards past relationships because I need to know what the situation is. 

She talks about two ex boyfriends and a guy she recently was with who kind of sucked and at this point I’m like...oh god this isn’t a date. 

Then she asks about my love life and so I just say yeah I don’t date men. She says ‘so you date women’ and I say yeah. She talks about having gay friends etc and then says ‘she thinks she’s probably heterosexual’. 

Anyway turns out she literally lives twenty steps from me and her bedroom window is right on my alleyway. So now I have an Italian friend who has the same taste as me in everything and who I can talk to easily and who is super hot and who has a fucking cute window in my fucking cute alleyway.

We both graduated a year or two ago. Our friendship has been up and down. We were really close then lived together which negatively affected our relationship. Then we got a lot closer now. So I was excited to tell her because it’s new for me. She pretty much just said do what you have to do. She didn’t ask ANY questions. She didn’t ask what her name was, how we met, how it’s going. If I would’ve said I was talking to a guy she would’ve found his parents home on Zillow and stalked all of his social media (slight exaggeration but you get it). So it’s been a few weeks and we’ve hung out a few times since I told her and she hasn’t asked me a single thing about how it’s going. At all. But she’s seeing a guy right now and texts me all the time about him or tells me every time I see her. I ask all the questions to show I care. But she never does the same.

I was chatting with I girl I'd been crushing on on and off for the last few weeks, not really about anything specific, art, D&amp;D, anime, stuff like that I think. 
But somehow I ended up telling her that I've had a gay dating app on my phone for over a year now but am too scared to use it, also girls probably won't wanna date someone who looks like a 14 year old boy on her pictures. (I actually really often get mistaken for one... I'm 20)
She interrupted me and said ""I think you're pretty!!"" and I blushed and said ""I think you're pretty too!""

I know for a fact that she's queer. On Twitter she occasionally retweets something along the lines of ""I want a gf"" and also tweeted two weeks ago that she has a date, but no update after that on how it went.

4692,Help me figure a girl out,"So there is this girl at college that I was 85% sure was into me. She's usually a very friendly, hyperactive and eloquent person but would always become super conscious and contained around me in a discussion class (maybe because I appear sophisticated at first too). She ticked all the usual and unusual signs of attraction to someone (me). I only had her for two classes last semester so I didn't think too much of this and I found it kind of amusing/cute that I made her nervous. (I would be happy to elaborate on this in pm if somebody would like to know.) Last week, I went to debate club for the first time and found out that she is on the committee and while most of the committee was very friendly, she acted super indifferent. I caught her staring a lot of times but otherwise she was just going around hugging her friends although she seemed 'tamer' than when I have seen her without her knowing (walking between classes or cafes). The worst is that she was supposed to take down my email and was told to do it 5 times by diff people but never asked me. I don't know whether she dislikes me (in which case I would be wrong about everything) or didn't know how to approach me. At one point somebody pointed her out to me to introduce us and she was supposed to say something but was taken by surprise and couldn't form a coherent sentence. I was discouraged by this behavior immediately after it but in hindsight it could just have to do with nerves, so here I am asking you all form some input. I am extremely feminine and while I like girls (recently found out), I have only ever dated boys. There isn't anything about me that says I'm bi/lesbian even though I am, so maybe that contributes to this in some way. What do you guys think?

For context, we're both early 20s and I'm a student in my final year of undergrad while she's in a year long internship program nearby. Both of us will be moving away from the town soon so I'm not sure if she wants to pursue more, although when she asked me if I saw the date as a romantic or friend date during the first date, I said romantic and she seemed relieved. She's also very cute and definitely my type so I was thinking of following up with a text like ""Sorry if I seemed nervous last night, I was distracted by how cute and funny you were.""

4723,Frida Khalo is Amazing!,"So, I learned about the lesbianism of Frida khalo in Spanish. We just watched a video about her life and it is a fact that she took both female and male lovers. She was also one of the first female artists to be featured and not belittled and whatnot. She also wore men’s clothes a lot. She went to high school with mostly boys, and she even pulled pranks with her mostly male friends. Her paintings are amazing and are very personal. She mostly painted for herself or the ones she loved. She had a very painful childhood. She got polio at 6, survived it. She broke the bottom half of her body in a bus crash, survived that. She disliked her body after that and always thought she was ugly, but any queer woman would beg to differ! 

I only put down stuff I remember from the video, some of that might be a bit wrong.

4724,What's a good dating app for lesbians?,"Hey y'all! So I turned 18 a while back and at this point I'm kind of desperate for a GF, or at the very least a date. My track record with women that I've met hasn't been great. While obviously other women aren't obligated to date me, it still sucks to get ghosted or get a ""no"" after ""no"". I try and go out to queer events and have joined all the LGBT clubs in my college, and I'm very active. No one has really expressed interest. Not to mention that being 18 means I still can't go to 99% of gay bars in my area. Thus, dating apps. 

I just want to know what would be a good dating app for me to try. Most dating apps have mediocre reviews, and my friends have mixed opinions. Some of my friends say Tinder works fine, others say it's terrible unless you want a hook-up or to feel shitty about yourself. Some people say Bumble is better, others say it's trash. And a lot of my friends are judging me for even considering dating apps, which makes me hesitant to ask more about it. So, what would be some good apps to look into and try out?

I either find the horniest of them all, she wakes me up in the middle of the night for phone sex, she’s constantly sending me nudes, and refuses to have conversations with me that aren’t sex focused. By the end of the week I know her vagina inside and out but, I couldnt tell you her favorite color, or what part of the continent she lived. 

Or it’s the girl who has sewn her hip to one, or more other girls. I don’t mind, I’m not saying she can’t friends, or lots of friends. I’m not even saying they shouldn’t hang out so much. *What I am saying is* if you’re going to pester me for upwards of two weeks about seeing me, I make the time to spend with you, and then *on the day* say you can’t hang out because you’re choosing your friends, then *don’t bother me*. 

You wanna see me that bad, you know where I live. Nothing’s stopping you from showing up! I’m tired of making plans, waiting a week, just so they fall apart, because I’m clearly (and blatantly) the bottom of the totem pole. It seriously makes me wanna never make plans, ever. They don’t get how much it hurts my feelings when they “bail” for their “best friend”. I can understand and respect their relationship, it’s being slapped with it that I don’t find very kind. Once, twice, I can shake it, I don’t wanna come off as jealous. When it’s several times over, and over the course of *years*; I give the hell up. 

Sorry, for any miswording. I’m just a very frustrated bi girl who understands other women even less than she thought.

I could just lift her up and follow her demands, listen to all of her whims all day long…

And god damn it I had to ruin the moment…

How did I even step on her shoe? I didn’t say sorry properly... Just mumbled something… Where did all my confidence go?

Fuck.

4743,Long Weird vent about a friend,"So basically I told my friend I like girls  ( still sorting myself out though) and she told me ""aww cute but you don't look like one"" and I was like wait... Ummm... Okay.... And then I just awkwardly joked about it and then she said ""all those boys clothes"" and listen I don't wear boys clothes, I just have a boys jacked that is honestly the best jacket for the cold plus it makes me look cute and I wear a lot of hoodies bcs it's cold. Anyway I forgot about it and then today we were watching sex education 2 ( which btw has so much positive wlw and mlm and asexual representation that it really makes me soo fucking happy I can't say how happy I am about it) and then she said ""gay people are jumping around until they have  found the right person and the lesbians are very  territorial, lol if they see you with another person they are gonna beat you and this girl is asexual maybe she hasn't found the right person"" and I was like well that's.... I don't thing that's a not so  nice thing to say....  And idk it's weird now... Like I expected this thing from my mom or dad ... But not really from her, and I feel like I should just explain to her that I am not saying I am a lesbian but I am not saying that I am  not either and that I know I just like girls, I don't know if there is a full stop after, or if I will add and boys too.

I kinda of feel like the line on word after to type a sentence and that like thing  that is popping in and out and you don't know if you wanna continue or not. I am that line. 
But after all those things she said I don't think I could tell her anymore  bcs don't really think she would get it.

Honestly feel like I am over thinking  this quite a lot.

I feel like I am just bitching about it and saying she is a shitty person and she isn't. I trust her more or less and I wish I told her that I was lonely as fuck last year bcs I didn't talk to anyone about this at all and for more than a year I have been thinking about it and I just wanted to talk to a human about it. Honestly deep down I am scared she will tell other people and one day I will come to my marketing class and everyone will start making fun of me. But she didn't tell anyone and I told her not to break my trust. 

Side note : I really do love the sex education show it really makes me happy and proud to be proud of this generation that says its okay to talk about mental health. Women who have had recieved some type of unwanted sexual attention should talk about it because I know more girls who that would say that they have been sexually assaulted than girls who say they haven't.

4745,Cuddles Again,"""Babe have you seen my charger? "" 
I asked after checking everywhere I could.
""Oh you finally remembered to charge..""
She was so rude. 
""Excuse me, Ma'am I need the charger right now!! "" I was screaming, my phone was almost dead. 
"" Baby, if I don't charge this thing,  you have no clue about your battery.  I searched for the charger, couldn't find it. So I gave up "" 
She was picking up toys while answering me.
""Okay. Then find me that now please ""
""OMG how can I know where you threw it,  you dumb Mowgli. Leave me alone ""
Okay that's my wife. Ignoring me and my phone. I was really annoyed cause I was working on something  and was about to lose it.
We don't have too many things in this little house. We know what we have, we don't lose things easily. Okay mommy minutes later my phone was dead.  So bad,  this phone has no other friendly charger. I was so done, exhausted. So I went to the blobs room to get some ""lovexygon"" for my lungs. 

Ooh my heart dropped. My little blob was playing all alone ,  up side down in her little crib with a pink ball. 

Her chubby tiny legs were on the crib gates, and hitting it softly. 

""oh what are you doing here my angel blob""  I bent over and kissed her almost bold head. She smells so good. I was sniffing her growing tiny little brown hair. She looked up,  with her big brown sparkling eyes, with long pretty lashes. 

""Are you smiling at me,  you my Mowgli baby"" 

I tickled her naked back and neck.. She loves that. Just like her mama. She started giggling with no teeth -cute mouth. She was just wearing a little nappy. Just like a baby Mowgli.

I, kissed her little tummy, tickling her tiny feet. 

She was laughing so hard,  oh those pinky cheeks just like my wife...

""Oh what's happening here,,,,""
My wife came in, pinching my bum, kissing my neck..

""So this little buddy here , helping mommy to charge her phone? ""

Our blob has a smile all over her face all the time, that no one can handle. Oh dear God My heart. She is gorgeous.

"" Actually she is charging my tired old soul "" I was mumbling.

""Oh really,, Is there any thing your wife can do to your old tired soul. May be I can charge a bit,  with my...... You know... ""

She whispered in her horny unbearable voice, grabbing my bum again. 

""Beiiiibbee"" I turned back to know if our toddler was around. She is catching words easily these days.

"" Whatchuu Look'n at ""
"" Where is she?? ' that tiny mushroom head. I can't see her""
""I saw her in our room..""
""Okayyy then, let's find out what your sister is doing""

I bent over to take my blob, and that's when my wife pinned me against the crib with her lower belly, and there, hugging me around my chest. OMG I can't do this with these three little clingy birds. I was smiling and complaining... 

"" Beiibbee  Horny much?? ""

I took the still giggling little blob who was so excited to hide in my chest. My wife hugged both of us. And kissed both our heads. 

"" My life, my life,  my life "" she 
was sniffing our blobs head and my neck back and forth. 

Then we slowly moved to our cozy bedroom, to grab our toddler into  this family cuddles. 

For a sec I got a heart attack. She wasn't on the bed. My wife was terrified.
She went back to the lounge room and was screaming our todlers name for a while . My heart stopped and I couldn't breathe.

""She is not there, babe ""
My wifes voice was breaking and she was half crying,

I couldn't stand any longer with my shaking legs,  I kept the blob on the bed to catch my breath to think. 

But then.. suddenly... 
we heard a little sobbing under the bed..

We both looked at each other and shared the same look for a minute and quickly kneeled down and bent to see what's under the bed. 

Oh there she is.. Hiding and crying all alone like a little bunny..
My wife dragged her out to see what was happening. 

Oh my all dusty little baby, soaking wet cheeks, tiny  and red, half closed eyes.. Sobbing so deeply.. 

I felt so bad.. I  started crying and hugging my little baby girl. 

""What's wrong honey.. What happened...""

She hugged me and started screaming, and repeating..


""I'm sorry mommy ""

We were so confused until my wife saw what's in her pocket, 

It was my charger, not in one piece. But several tiny pieces. And there was a poor helpless scissor on the floor as well. I don't know from where she found it. But we both were sharing blank looks, until we both laughed it out after a long family cuddling and kissing session. 

Well Good Thing is I found my charger though it's not in the best condition, but I can't complain for tiny experiments, Can I?

4769,Guilt Over Childhood Fear,"I (27) was really scared of being gay growing up. My family is Catholic, I grew up in a very conservative community, and I felt like the worst thing I could be was gay. I was worried that if I spent time around lesbians, I would become one. If I felt warmth and attraction when I was around another girl, I decided it meant THEY must be gay...so I avoided a lot of people...

Welp, I'm finally out. 

And I was talking to my gf about the way I felt about the community growing up and her reaction made me feel extraordinarily guilty/shitty. She was raised by liberal parents in a very liberal area and can't fathom feeling as terrified of queerness as I was when I was little. She was trying to understand, but I could tell that she just couldn't - I think it made her feel like I'm currently judging her, too (not a thing). 

For others who are also gay but who grew up feeling similarly fearful of this aspect of themselves: do you feel guilt over how you previously felt about our community? If so, how are you working to let go/how have you let go of the guilt? 

I think I just need to hear that other people had similar experiences to mine, because right now I just feel like a jerk (even though I know it came from a place of fear of myself).

My name is Sarah Spicer and I am an investigative reporter working for Columbia Journalism Investigations and ProPublica. Currently, I am working on a story on how Grindr and other LGBTQ dating apps investigate reports of sexual assault on their application. I am committed to the truth and this will be the deepest story written about this topic.

I’m sorry to bother you all on this subreddit, as I know it isn't the purpose, but I am hoping you might fill out this form with your experiences on dating apps. (Even non-LGBTQ - I am part of a four person team and we are interested in all stories.) We are also looking for people with law enforcement background or who might know something about the dating app industry.

No story is too small.  

I wouldn’t ask this if it wasn’t important.

If you click on the link below, you will see that it is an entirely voluntary form with the option to remain as anonymous as the user likes. Additionally, if they don’t want to be contacted by me later, that is also an option.

4785,"The whole ""invalid lesbian"" feeling - how the hell do we deal with it?","I've been very frustrated lately in the feeling that no one ever believes me when I say that I am gay. I'm still very young (16) so that already gives people an excuse to question me. What's more is that there was a little over a year in between being kinda-out and fully-out in which I went hardcore teenage girl heterosexual. I dated a lot of guys and talked about them constantly and told lies about myself about fifty times a day just to convince people that I'm *definitely definitely definitely* not gay. 

So there's that whole story I have to carry around with me. I feel as if I must explain this very personal and complicated thing to people who knew me during that period so that they don't show skepticism of my identity as a lesbian.

There's also the whole femme/butch dynamic. As much as I adore lesbian culture and the colorful spectrum of butches and femmes and those that layeth betwixt, it can be kind of confusing. I feel like if I don't cut off a bunch of my hair and throw out all my skirts no one will ever believe me that I'm a lesbian, and not bisexual. My style is sort of an ambiguous mix of feminine (long hair, makeup, skirts and super gay earrings) and masculine (vests, blazers and one super gay jacket). I like the way I dress and how I present myself, but I'm worried people will interpret me as someone who 's just going through a phase.

Indeed, I've been told by several ex-boyfriends who heard about me coming out that I'm just going through a phase, and that I was all together too enthusiastic in our previous relationships to be anything other than a mildly bi-curious attention whore. Of course those weren't their exact words, but you can imagine the conversations that were had. 

So idk. Maybe I just care too much about what other people think, which is partly very true. I like myself, and I'm certain of myself. But I'm constantly fearful of others not liking me and others not being certain of me. It's sort of a reverse imposter syndrome. Actually it might just be regular imposter syndrome. Idk I'm not a fucken scientist.

The reason I'm posting this is because I'm just dying for some advice from older, wiser homosexuals on how to deal this. Also, where did this impression come from? Is porn to blame? Insecure ex-boyfriends? My own internalized homophobia?

4789,Is there a bias for tops VS bottoms?,"I’ve always described myself as a top, like very very much a top. (Always &amp; only giving, never receiving). 

I think that was due to being with girls who were unsure/questioning their sexuality and didn’t like the idea of “doing” a girl but were perfectly fine with receiving sexual favors from a girl (me, in these situations). 

When I told them I was a top, they felt more like more of a “woman” and “less gay” which was a relief for them because they didn’t want to acknowledge sexuality / Self-Internalized homophobia. 

However I recently hooked up with this bi girl who was definitely very into girls. Everything was equal and I always thought I was too insecure to bottom and I didn’t even want to ask for it. But this girl really wanted to so I let her and it was great, 10/10, never thought I could enjoy myself like that. 

Earlier that day at dinner, all my straight/bi girl friends said I totally seem like a bottom. I asked my gay/bi girl friends and they said the same thing. 


So I’m wondering: Does labeling yourself things like switch or a bottom get a bad rep amongst lesbians? I only know that it typically scares off straight girls who are questioning. What do lesbians typically think?",actuallesbians,1579410912,theM00nisGAY,,1,True,2020-01-19
4790,Does anyone else ever feel isolated from the larger LGBT+ community?,"Fuck I don't know why I'm writing this,  but I feel the urge to.   Does anyone else feel like they don't really fit into the larger LGBT+ community in any meaningful way?   With the exception of this sub I don't really like a part of anything remotely resembling a community.  I recently unsubbed to all the LGBT+ subs I had joined for a lot of reasons and this includes dedicated trans spaces. 

I'm bisexual  with an attraction slanted extremely heavily towards women both sexually and romantically,  but do feel a certain degree of attraction to men,  have  no interest in dating men/men aligned people,  and I don't experience the bicycle.  It feels like I'm not gay enough for the lesbians and don't fit perfectly into lesbian culture,  too gay/exclusive for the bisexual crowd,  and frankly the less I'm on the cishet radar the better.  Then we have the gay/lesbian folks who think people like me are walking disease carriers,  cheaters,  cocksluts,  will leave them for the other gender,  and worse,  and want us gone from the community. 

Then we have the fuckery that comes with being trans and the view some LGB folks have of me.  I'm a deluded and mentally ill man who wants to rape people,  make lesbians like dick,  has no respect for boundaries,  invades queer spaces,  and is all in all a mentally ill sexual predator who hates gay people.  (I shit you not.  Some LGB folks consider trans people inherently anti gay).  This is before we into the fuckery that is the TERFs and cis lesbians who are a part of that.  It does not help with my struggle with dysphoria,  feeling valid a bi woman,  and wlw. 

I kind of feel like an outcast among outcasts.  No real place for me to call home in the community and like I'm some sort of queer freak who's going to die alone,  unloved,  and friendless.  I just...fuck.  I'd like to find my place you know?

4798,"Needing some advice! Specifically from lesbians who are also ace, or lesbians who lost virginity later in life.","Hiya,

I have been wanting to ask a question like this for a while, didn't know who to go to since I don't have a ton of LGBTQ friends, so when I found this subreddit, I decided to finally make a reddit account (it was bound to happen sooner or later with how often I lurk lol) to see if I could get some help with this.

Anyhow, sorry this might be a little long but I'll try to keep it as short as possible.

I need help in trying to figure out if I might be ace or just really repressed?

I know I have a romantic attraction to women, and I'm generally all up for hand-holding, hugs, cuddling, and kisses. But I've recently come to terms with the fact that I'm super disinterested in sex. I used to think that was normal, or a result of being in denial about being a lesbian for so long, but I'm not sure anymore and have been considering if I might be ace or fall somewhere on that spectrum.

For some quick background, I'm a cis lesbian in my early twenties. I found that I was attracted to women back when I was 13. I decided to ignore that, figured life would be even harder if I were to be gay, and focused on trying to find a guy I liked. That never happened, ofc, and I went through all of my adolescence wondering why I couldn't find a guy who I actually would consider dating or pursuing.(I already knew why lol, I was just deep in denial and internalized homophobia). Eventually, in my junior and senior year of college, I finally came out to myself and dealt with a lot of the negative feelings I had about being a lesbian. Then I graduated, and finally started dating women.

Which was great! Finally went on my first proper date, got my first kiss, cuddled, experienced being with women in a romantic context and found that I really liked it. I still have no sexual experience however, and a few months ago, I was actively looking for hook-up partners since I felt a little inadequate about my sexual experience (like I wasn't a real adult or something, or that my virginity could scare away potential serious partners in the future). Almost went through with it, but found that I had no interest in doing anything like that at all. In fact, when I think about sex now, with women and with me being an active participant, I just feel really weird about it. I've fantasized about relationships without sex or with very little sex. The concept of being with someone really sexual or someone who needs a lot of sex in their lives, both puts me off and intimidates me. But I honestly don't now if this is because I'm genuinely ace or because I might be really repressed and scared of being vulnerable like that since I have 0 experience.

I'm getting back to dating soon, and I would love to have some more clarity on this so I can be as honest as I can with myself and others when I do.

TLDR: I'd love to hear from lesbians who are also ace and how y'all have dealt with coming to that realization that they were ace, or from lesbians who came into their own later than adolescence and had to lose their virginity later than most and what that experience was like for them.

Me and my girlfriend compete in Speech and Debate again each other almost every other weekend. The activity is actually how we met. We also compete in the same exact event as well. Today she opened up to me about how she’s felt since we started dating. I pretty much consistently “perform” better and go to finals, winning first or second place. I’m proud of myself, but I don’t hype myself up much and mainly focus on her successes, which I’m okay with. It’s so tricky competing against someone you love so much because you don’t want to react in a certain way that would make them feel less of themselves. I’ve done my best to regulate my reactions. But today my girlfriend said, crying, that she feels like no one cares about her success as much as they do mine, and how they constantly ask her how I’m doing. She admitted she was jealous of me. All I could think of doing was comforting her and saying that so many people care, and just reassuring that ultimately we’re not really against each other or actually competing, it’s just something we are meant to enjoy. She said that it’s not fun for her anymore because she’s too worried about embarrassing herself in front of me if she doesn’t succeed well. I really don’t know what to do. I don’t know how to fully approach this situation. I guess it just makes me sad that my success ultimately hurts her. Because I want her to be happy, but I also want to do my best at all times.

4806,Crushed Babygay Needs YOUR Advice!,"Hi! So I actually made a reddit account just to post this because I am desperate for some sort of advice or empathy or wisdom or something from, well... actual lesbians!
Be warned, this post is a little vent-ish!!

Tonight I went on my third date with a girl and thought it was going amazingly until she told me she needed to tell me something.  This something was that she’s not actually attracted to me and doesn’t want this to go any further.

She’s a lovely girl.  I was really truly enamored.  But that’s not why it hurts so bad.  It hurts so bad because this has happened before.  In fact, it has happened multiple times before.  Girls date me and then realize they either aren’t into women or they just aren’t into me.
It feels embarrassing to even admit this because on paper it screams “something is wrong with this chick!!” Why else would this happen continuously?  But I genuinely don’t think I’m doing anything off-putting.  I try my best to always be a good listener, to have an easygoing manner, etc.  I’m not ugly.  Plus I can make girls laugh!  They always want to stay close friends, so logically, it can’t be that I’m just a bore... right?

And so my anxiety brain starts to gnaw at my entire psyche screaming “YOU ARE UNLOVABLE BECAUSE WOMEN DON’T LIKE SHORT FEMMES WITH HIGH PITCHED LAUGHS AND ONLY DATE BIG STRONG BUTCHES AND YOU WILL NEVER SATISFY A WOMAN EVER”.  Ouch.  Not a good thought to have!  Or a logical one!  But it just spirals more and more into more illogical lies.  Even sometimes “you should just date men because only men could be attracted to you and be the more dominant  personality type you like.” And then I start to wonder if I should settle for men to protect myself from getting hurt.

I know!!! It’s so emo and stupid.  But damn, I’m so discouraged!  It’s hard to imagine women liking me after so many times of getting “I think you’re really sweet, I’m just not attracted to you...” 

I’m a really young adult.  College age.  I know I have my whole life ahead of me.  But it’s hard to convince an anxious, pattern-recognizing brain of that.

So, lesbians, I guess what I’m asking for is... whatever you have to say!  Empathy, encouragement, advice?  Do you relate?  Did you once relate?  Even just saying you like really feminine girls might give my brain a little boost of “oh... maybe I AM valid!”  I just feel like a fragile ball of Gay floating all alone through the universe.  Blah.

I seriously doubt she will probs ever speak to me again after the amount of awkwardness and social anxiety I was projecting. It was embarrassing. I just got tongue tied and all weird :/ like... I’m not usually THAT weird but yesterday idk I went too quiet at some points and then talked too much about myself and then idk. The date itself was cool. We went on a mini urban exploring adventure and ended up back at my place playing guitar and singing. but I have NO IDEA what constitutes dating or how to go about it?? Like? I guess I’m doing it without thinking about it. I want to find love. But I don’t know how. Sex Ed never mentions what you do when you’re gay 😂. I’m so sad and stuck because I really really like this girl but I can’t seem to do anything right. At least, I judge myself all the time when I talk to her. I hate myself and get down and out about the way I’m acting, when it doesn’t even seem to be me? Like I’m not myself. Does it usually take longer than 2 dates to know whether you like like someone? Am I meant to feel so weird? And if I do like her what the fuck do i do? Cheers in advance dudes :)",actuallesbians,1579430324,sadbean303,,1,True,2020-01-19

We surprisingly have a lot of stuff in common she said and I feel out of depth I don't know if I showed enough excitement or not because I was also a bit tired from my the long studious hours we did in a Starbucks lel

God knows it's been hard

4848,Talking to my gf about how her mom makes me feel,"My gf (25) and I (26) have been together for a year. She is Chinese American and I’m white.

Her mom is very intense. I hesitate to use that word because I am not trying to feed into stereotypes, but it is truly the most accurate descriptor for her personality. And she has had half a decade to come to terms with the fact that my gf is gay, but her mom still calls me her “friend.” Up until a couple of years ago, I guess she was still trying to set my gf up with guys. 

Her mom calling me her daughter’s friend is really frustrating. I already feel like I’m not good enough for her because I’m white and her mom’s refusal to acknowledge who I actually am to her daughter makes that feeling more pronounced.

I tried to calmly and kindly explain my feelings to my gf. I basically just said that I respect her mom and I appreciate that her mom is most times kind to me when I see her, but it hurts that her mom talks about me as though we are just acquaintances. Also that it hurts that I know her mom only ever wanted her to marry a Chinese American man and that is not me. 

My gf basically shut down emotionally for a good 20 minutes and finally re-emerged with “my mom has always been kind to you, why are you talking about her like this?” 

I even used “I feel” statements the whole time, so I don’t understand why she thinks I’m judging her mom...? 

Should I just not talk to her about how her mom makes me feel? Just stomach it and let it go? I don’t know what else to do.",actuallesbians,1579458299,laxcaroline,,1,True,2020-01-19

4850,Femme presenting but gender confused,"Hey everyone. I have a kind of confusing problem I'd like your perspectives on. Thank you in advance 💖

I've identified as a lesbian for years, and I'm dating a wonderful woman who loves and accepts me. I'm attracted only to women (lots of shapes and sizes, femme and butch!).  I present real feminine (long hair, dresses most of the time, earrings, makeup, jewellery etc.) but something doesn't feel quite right. I don't really identify strongly with womanhood at all, or any feminine traits. When someone refers to me as a woman, I feel like they're mis-identifying me, or not quite seeing me for who I am. I have a strong personality, which I've been described as a tomboy before. This obviously doesn't match with how I dress, although that's not always a bad thing. 

I especially struggled in my teens with body image, I detested my breasts beyond a doubt, and my hips meant clothes barely fit me. For a while this, combined with attraction to women, led me to believe I was FtM. I wore binders and presented as male as possible for a while. But after a while I realised I didn't want that either. The feeling has never gone away, it just comes and goes every so often. 

I had a frank conversation with my gf about this last night. Now she's worried about me, as I may have unresolved gender issues. But I don't even know where to start - I dress so feminine as an AFAB person, it wouldn't make sense for me to be GQ or GF or NB. I feel like I fit in this community but only because I love women, not necessarily because I feel strongly that I'm a woman. 

Any thoughts would be appreciated. If anyone has felt similar, how did you explore these feelings?",actuallesbians,1579459585,awollihs,,1,True,2020-01-19

4862,"I'm desperately in love with my bestfriend of 8 YEARS and yep you guessed it, she's STRAIGHT...I think? Read my rant if you dare...","So I (23f) think I'm in love with my bestfriend (23f). I think I'm deeply in love with her. Well I know I am, but the question is whether it's platonic or romantic (I guess that's not even really a question anymore but I digress). We've been friends for 8 years. We became bestfriends almost instantly after we met. We've always been really attached to eachother actually, maybe even codependent. We text everyday, call almost every night and see eachother as often as possible. We've helped eachother deal with our mental health issues and trauma, and helped eachother through life-altering family changes and events. She's become a really huge part of my life and I'm closer to her than I ever have been with anyone else.

I've always thought I was straight but now I'm not so sure. As far as I know she is straight, but we've never really talked about it. We've never really had to as I've always only been attracted to guys (though I've never been opposed to dating women, just never met the right one I suppose?). We've both had our share of boyfriends and boy drama. She was engaged to a guy for about a year as well (more on that below). And we've both helped eachother through heartbreaks and relationships.

But somewhere along the line I've developed some sort of feelings for her. I obviously love her as a friend, she's an amazing person and a great friend. She's funny, kind, caring, talented, beautiful and all around just awesome. I love everything about her. When we talk I feel okay for once and comfortable- she gets me and I get her kind of thing. We've told eachother deep personal things about eachother, stuff we wouldn't dare tell anyone else. Now lately (over the past couple years) I feel like I've grown more attached to her. I first realized the feelings when a very traumatic experience happened for her, I had to travel across the state to help her. When I initially got the call these feelings sort of rushed over me. I've always felt something for her, I knew something was there, but this was overwhelming. I just knew I needed her to be okay and that I deeply loved her and didn't want to lose her.

So now...I'm in deep. I can't wait to talk to her throughout the day. We can talk for hours on end, and everytime we hangout I don't wanna stop being with her. I get so sad when I have to leave that it almost brings me to tears. We share a bed when I stay the night and I never want morning to come. When we hug I never want to let her go. When something significant happens in my life she's the first person I call. If she's upset or something bad happens, my stomach tightens up and I can't breathe until I make sure she's okay. I don't know if this is because what happened to her- we both have a history of mental struggles and I'm constantly worried about her and if she's okay. I just don't know why but I can't stop thinking about her- and it's killing me.

I get the sense that she feels something for me too. A lot of the time since this traumatic event happened, she'll stay really close to me when we're together or sit really close to me. She rubs my back a lot or my arm and will grab my hand or my leg if she's feeling anxious. We've had so many intimate moments. We talk about how much we love eachother, how much we mean to eachother. Sometimes when I'm upset or anxious, she hugs me for like 5-10 minutes straight, I've done the same with her. She once sat with me through a whole night when I was having a mental breakdown and literally comforted me till I came back to reality. She also has gone excessively out of her way for me: sacrificing things to help me, getting me gifts or planning extravagant outings for my birthday. We've gone through so much with eachother, we have every aspect of being in a relationship minus the sex. I can never tell though if she's just being a really good, loving friend, or if she wants something more.

BUT here's the kicker. She's dating a guy right now. I haven't had any significant love interest in around 2 years (which I think can be attributed to how emotionally unavailable I am since I've uncovered these feelings for her). And her guy is really great, but for some reason I can't tame my jealousy when I'm around the two of them. When she mentions him I just get pissed off. Usually I never minded hearing about her boyfriends. The first time I noticed jealousy was when her previous boyfriend proposed- I didn't know why I was furious about her being engaged. I thought it was because I hated the guy. I ended up starting a fight with her over it and we didn't talk for about 6 months (after that she broke it off with that guy). I don't want to go that route with her current bf: who honestly is really a good guy. That would be selfish, and I feel like I should just let them be. I'm happy for her, I want her to be happy- but part of me wants to confess how I feel about her and see if the feelings are reciprocated.

The problem is I would hate to do that to her especially because I don't even know what these feelings are myself. And even if they are reciprocated I don't know that I would want a relationship with her. There's just feelings there though that I can't shake and I feel like it will ruin our friendship if I don't get it off my chest with her. She's going to start wondering why I'm being aloof and jealous and protective. We're bestfriends and I know she can already tell something's up. So I'm looking for advice on how I should go about this. If I say something to her what would I even say? Does this sound like I'm in love or just super attached to a bestfriend?

4864,Things a cis straight guy can do to not violate a safe space?,"First - read the rules and think I'm okay here but obviously if I'm doing something I shouldn't please let me know! I'm a straight cis married guy so I think they wouldn't take this post on other subs (like realesbians) but I didn't see anything to make me think I couldn't post here.

I wanted to get some input and don't have a lot of lesbian friends so thought ""why not reddit?"" after some unsuccessful googling.

I recently bonded with a lesbian friend at work and she asked if I wanted to go with her to a lesbian bar (maybe she's looking for someone there - maybe not - I'm unclear). I think she's asking because she wants to hang out with me but in a safe feeling space? I'd love to go but...well since I just said that I think her choice in venue might be because it's a space SHE feels safe in I don't want to break that sort of environment for someone else.

I've gone with gay male friends to gay bars but it's sometimes been rocky when other people found out I was straight (they thought I was after single women there, I think). Might there be a similar issue at a lesbian bar? Is there something I could do to mitigate it? I want to be supportive of my friend while not making anyone else feel out of sorts.

4879,A girl I like.,"The last time I’ve fallen in love with a girl was when I was 17 years old. As years pass by now I’m 24, and yet I still haven’t fallen in love with a woman. I’ve had small innocent crushes but that’s it. 

Though, I can’t help but think of my last female crush. I also can’t help but think how good we could’ve been together. 

She was slightly shorter than I was. I stand five foot tall and four inches. When I stand next to her I was able to see the top of her head. I thought it was funny but I also felt protective whenever I would stand next to her.  she had dark hair up to her shoulder hair and she always had pinned backed to her ears. She wore little to no make up. I thought she looked beautiful without it. She looked so raw, so genuine without it. I always enjoy women without make up. Her skin was brown like honey. Her almond shaped eyes would always sparkle when she made eye contact. I couldn’t help but stare at her eyes a little longer. She would always shy away because of this. I didn’t know exactly why I felt this way for her. She’s a very pretty girl, but not what I would call my “type”. She wasn’t as tall as me, her style didn’t match mine. Her looks didn’t catch my eye. 

She was very quiet. She looked very shy but motivated. I know mentally we were both on the same level. Unfortunately, I didn’t have enough time to get to know her. But when we talked I wanted to know more about her. And she wanted to know more about me. It took me while, but she was very interested in me. And I know she felt the same way. On our last day together, it was a bittersweet moment. I was so ready to end the course. I hated the material but we worked very good together. She knew it would probably be the last time we see each other. She was more talkative than usual that day. It’s been over a month since I last saw her. And I can’t stop thinking of her. Hopefully one day we can meet again.",actuallesbians,1579474106,sg3231,,1,True,2020-01-19

4882,I got an awkward do not have sex while on this medication talk. It was not even my medication. I just have the need to vent about the ridiculousness of this situation right now.,"^TL ^DR ^at ^the ^bottom

Recently I got to pick up my mom's medication at the pharmacy. I'm not going to tell you what exactly the medication is but it is rather heavy duty. You should be 100 percent sure that you are not pregnant before taking it and even after you stop taking it you should not get pregnant for 3 years. It is proven that if you do get pregnant within 3 years after stopping to take the medication, it will have massive negative effects on the child's development and the chances of a miscarriage are ridiculously high. 

This doesn't bother my mom as she is too old to have kids anyways. I on the other hand am 18 years young and apparently look like I am in my early 20s which admittedly is a pretty fertile age. So I am not mad that I got the talk. I just find the whole situation absolutely ridiculous. 

Before I get people commenting: ""Why didn't you just say that the medication isn't for you?"" let me tell you that I am 90 percent sure that I technically was not allowed to pick this particular medicine up for my mom but in an attempt of being a good daughter for once, I still did it. Yeah, usually you are allowed to get your relatives medication or at least you are allowed to do that in my country. I don't know about other countries. 

However, this was rather heavy duty medication and there were lots of things that had to be explained about how to correctly take the medication and warnings about what you should avoid while on this medication (it's more than just sex, the sex talk just happened to be the longest).

I'm pretty sure the pharmacist saw that I am rather young and assumed that I have never had to take medication and would not read the patient information leaflet either. That man literally told me everything, even the most obvious things like don't take the medication with alcohol or drink alcohol after taking the medication.

Of course he eventually got to telling me about all the negative effects the medication could have on a pregnancy or rather on the unborn baby in great detail. Then he got into this whole tangent about how no type of contraception is 100 percent effective and how it would be the best choice to not have any sex at all. 

I was really close to telling him that I am a lesbian and just hoping that he isn't going to argue that pre op trans woman exist so that still isn't a 100 percent guarantee that I won't get pregnant. Before I could out myself like that he luckily stopped with the sex talk and got into how often you have to take how much of the medication.

So yeah, I decide to be a good daughter for once and I end up having a pharmacist tell me not to have sex. Absolutely absurd. 0/10 would not recommend.

^*TL DR: I picked up meds for my mom, pharmacist thought they were for me and gave me a ""don't have sex while on these meds"" talk*",actuallesbians,1579474957,RainyMcJay,,1,True,2020-01-19

She tells me how she didn't invite me up for sex. I tell her that's why I agreed to come up, that I like things slow. The next day we hang. We're in her bed, she's talking about vulnerability and her experiences, and how she doesn't know me but it seems ""like you're working on vulnerability."" All this stuff about wearing her heart on her sleeve. I tell her I need to go slow bc of being assaulted in the past. That that's why I'm not super vulnerable with everyone. That I'm seeing a therapist. She says ""I'm sorry, we can talk. Or not. Or I can hold you."" I say let's go back to what we're doing. We hook up, though I have to stop a few times. 

She texts me. We text this week. I meet her friends. We're kissing and she's all ""You still haven't told me what happened. I just want to make sure you're ok. Sometimes when I get going, I can't stop."" I say I'll let her know if I'm not ok, but I'm enjoying what we're doing. I confirm that she isn't hinting that I need to have sex her. She says no, she just wants to check if im ok. 

 Again, we wind up in her bed and shes saying all this stuff about vulnerability. ""I like to leave ppl better than I found them"" etc, how she just ""got over"" the walls she had. Asking me about relationships. Telling me how sexy she finds vulnerability. I'm dumb enough to think it's sweet. Keeps saying she wants to take me out for a proper date. She tells me to text her when I'm home, I do. We have tentative Fri plans. I hear nothing all day Thurs. Text her. She texts back. I send her some music. Nothing. Then Fri she's like ""Oh I want to take you out but I'm going to be all tired and sweaty and can we just do something low key or a late climb?"" I say ""Honestly, I'm really fried today :/ I'm sorry. Would you be cool w Sunday?"" Shes like ""yeah, sunday is fine."" I text her a time. She says that's fine. 

Then later that night, bc of all her vulnerability talk making me wonder if I'm being too closed off, I text her ""Sunday at x time sounds great. Hope you have a great night."" then ""Sorry about tonight, it's been a rough day. I worry I'd be bad company and just fall asleep beside you."" She responds later ""I'm home and all gross. Sorry you had a bad day."" I say thanks &lt;3 and flirt a bit, say she's cute when she's sweaty etc. She invites me over. I'm not sure how I feel, so I wait, maybe a jerk move. I didn't mean it to be. Text her 40 mins later, ask if I can still come over. She says no, she's busy, save it for Sun. I hear nothing yesterday. 

I text her this morning ""Hey hope you had a great weekend! Still on for tonight?"" Nothing. Til 4:30. ""I'm sorry I'm super hungover been sleeping all day."" I say ""all good, hah, shoot for tomo/next wk?"" She responds ""next week."" 

So yeah. I just got played hard by someone who threw notions of vulnerability in my face. Who bragged she was the opposite of me bc she learned to let her guard and walls down. Who told me how sexy it would be if I could, just to turn around and act like this. I'm tempted to text her ""Hey, this clearly isn't working out. Let's be friends. Hope it isn't awkward if we run into eachother at gym/gay league"" or just to not respond at all. But yeah, I am feeling very manipulated. Especially into feeling like I was being the ""tough exterior"" person in this sit. Like I had to express how interested I was to make her feel ok. Like I had to apologize for having barriers I'm working on. 

TLDR: I'm really sensitive to ppl implying I'm not emotionally open. This girl pressured and encouraged me to be emotionally open. Then turned into a giant jerk. Just feeling very hurt, and very against vulnerability, and feeling very played, and of course, wondering how I contributed. But mostly, just feeling very hurt and manipulated.",actuallesbians,1579492868,millenium_fulcrum,,1,True,2020-01-19

But then I’m shy and I think she is too so we don’t talk really after that incident.

4932,My weird older lesbian coworker,"Okay so when I was 19 I worked this place, the lady that trained me was clearly gay and her girlfriend worked there too. She was in her 50s ish. Well she kept talking about stuff that didn't interest me or I had nothing to add to (what 19 year old discusses home improvements and yard work?) 

Well because it was 3rd shift they allowed headphones for music, so when I completed my training I brought them and played music. She kept interrupting to talk. 

Then one day I came in on my day off to work a half day because they needed help. She decided to scream at me about how they should have made me work a full day and ""who do I think I am, I can't do my job right"" blah blah blah.  My coworkers said I did fine and they didn't know what her problem was (they heard her screaming).

Then and now looking back it's like she expected me to just be like ""yeah I'm a lesbian too"" and for us to be work buddies because of that.  Then resorted to screaming when I was just professional.  I talked to my other coworkers because they discussed things that interested me. 

Thing is I'm 27 and back working there temporarily. She still works there and we crossed paths the other day, she stood outside my office/work area thing and stared at me, I could see her while I was working on the computer. It was super uncomfortable trying to work while someone's staring. 

This is a weird post but I experienced this a couple times,  where I meet a fellow lesbian that behaves like were supposed to be instant friends when we all we have in common is being interested in women.  

I'm not really worried about her getting hostile again,  if she even remembers me because my office is litterally right next to my managers offices.

Accost her at work where she can't escape and there are customers waiting in line behind me listening to everything. Or...

Engage in some light Facebook stalking and ask her out for a drink over messenger.

-often times when she’s talking to me she’ll be very close to me and we’ll be touching shoulders or legs or something like that (this might just be me gay panicking and overthinking it tho) 

-i told her i was going to starbucks during my free period and she asked me if i could get her something and i went and brought her back her drink and food with all of the details and add ons she told me 

-one time i was giving her a ride home and it was cold and started raining so i gave her a soft blanket i had in my back seat and lover by taylor swift was playing on the radio while we were talking and joking around 

ik these could just be me overthinking things haha but could there be a chance she likes me ? even if she does i don’t know if we could actually date tho at least not openly because i’m white and she’s indian and her parents are kind of traditional :( idk if i should try to pursue something with her or not",actuallesbians,1579497583,throwawaybecauseahhh,,1,True,2020-01-20

4953,I’m truly a walking stereotype but I don’t care.,"I still love my ex, which is the main thing stopping me from getting into a relationship. Legit can’t catch/retain interest because she occupies my mind and heart. I don’t wanna try to force myself to move on when I’m not ready, because I would end up hurting people like she did to me. But cutting her out of my life doesn’t really pass the vibe check either. 

She broke up with me because she said she didn’t like me anymore, but around a month later she became (and still is) so physically affectionate. Even more than when we were actually together. I’m talking from holding hands to making out and saying “I love you.” I’m actually in a pretty good headspace receiving this affection, because I understand I can’t force someone to love me. I do sometimes feel judged for having this weird situationship, but it makes me happy from what I know of happiness. Just because I’m still friends with her doesn’t mean I’m not allowed to miss her and still feel hurt. 

I also don’t wanna perpetuate the stereotype that women are just naturally affectionate and therefore relationships between women aren’t real and valid, or that we’re showing affection for the attention of men, etc. Everyone in our friend circle know that we’re not actually together, but I still introduce her to strangers as my gf sometimes. 

(Example 1, driving her to her appointment) 

Me: can I get a parking pass please?
Receptionist: did you have an appointment? 
Me: no, I just drove my girlfriend here.

4959,I've feeling reached for help,"The last and only time I've ever talked and seen a therapist was during my years in college. At the time I was just seeking help in how to come to terms with feeling a bit lonely from the transition from high school to college and dealing with being away from family since I dormed. I was also seeking help a bit in dealing with my relationship with my girlfriend at the time. She wanted me to come out to my family but I wasn't feeling comfortable or ready to, especially since I depended on them for financial aid to go to college. I ended up doing couples therapy, which looking back on it was crap. The couple therapist was just not that great and didn't know what she was doing. Her therapist in training that would join her was better than her. The original individual therapist that I had seen before was a lot more understanding and compassionate. 

This past week I've been feeling like total shit to the point where I didn't see a reason to live anymore, what was the point? I pushed away close friends that genuinely cared about me and I hate myself for it. I isolated myself from people at work and I feel bad. My own thoughts sounded louder than what people were saying. I felt that no one cared about me but I knew that they did. I felt that no one wanted to approach me but I knew that if they did I would push back for the fear they would think that what I've been dealing with was small and stupid. That it was a stupid excuse to act the way that I've been since I came back to work from my ""vacation."" To me it wasn't a vacation. My close aunt died during the week of Christmas from supposed complications of diabetes but in reality it was her abusive ex husband and her abusive adopted son that killed her. On Christmas Eve my family and I got on a car and drove to her wake that happened on Christmas Day with me at the wheel the whole 8 hours. The cry from my cousin I will never forget, she was composed and held on so well with her newborn son until it was her turn to speak. Hearing the cries from my mom and sister got to me as well. I was so tired for being up for more than 24 hours in trying to be the composed strong one for my family. After seeing my aunt's ex husband and her adopted son, I started thinking back on my ex girlfriend that I had gone to couple's therapy with.

I've struggled the last 2 years in coming to terms of what had happened to me in that 6+ year relationship. I was abused in every form and the people that I thought were friends at the time did not tell me what I was going through was abuse. What I thought was just normal typical relationship stuff was actually toxic and not normal. I would be humiliated in front of ""friends"", I would be yelled at privately for not doing things correctly, I would have things thrown at me. I was gaslighted. And recently I found what I had dealt with that I thought was normal in a relationship, sexual coercion. It is a form of rape. I've barely told about three people very little about this for the fear that they wouldn't believe me. I've bottle a lot of things up and just left them fester, hoping that over time that it would just fix itself. Now I know from the events that happened this week that I needed to seek help. A really good friend of mine gave me a slap in the face and told me that I needed to deal with my problems and if needed, seek professional help. For the fact that she told me she was stepping away from me for her own health and well-being (she has her own demons that she battles) it made me realize I do need to take the proper steps in finding help. I wish I could get over all of this as quickly as possible but I know that that is not possible. I just need to take this one step at a time, one day at a time. Atm I've seeked out online therapy and I hope that will help me start my healing process. I am hoping that those that I care about that I've pushed away this past week will forgive me and continue to be my friends. I don't want to continue to feel alone, that I'm useless and that my problems don't mean anything anymore. I'm tired of it.

-Hearing her softly wimper
-Hearing her moan 
-The way her breasts feel heavy in my hands
-Feeling her start to relax when I kiss her neck and melt when I nibble on her ear
-Kissing my way up her smooth, thick thighs
-Running my fingers over her soft doughy tummy and dragging my tongue along the waistband of her boxer briefs
-Grasping her hips and feeling infinitely lucky that I get to do so (every single time)
-Teasing her and feeling her anticipation 
-Smelling the musk and sweat of her skin along her thighs and navel, the only places untouched by her cologne 
-How perfect her dripping, throbbing pussy looks 
-That first lick, her taste and her moan of relief
-Feeling her shake
-When she thrusts her hips up against me
-Getting absolutely coated in her wetness
-Feeling her pussy clench around my fingers as she gets close
-Feeling her clit under my fingers
-When I’m sitting in between her legs and her legs are draped over mine, and I can watch her beautiful body writhe and squirm under me. The image of her hoodie pushed up to her neck, her face pressed into the pillow. Her square jaw begging to be kissed and cherubic lips parted, ready for the next moan. Vulnerable and desperate 
-When she cums and her moans change, her eyes squeeze shut and she places her hand over mine to silently tell me to stop
-The way she instantly pulls me close to her after she cums. Sometimes she has post-orgasm sadness and when I hold her tight against me and rub her back it makes her feel better. Then she plants little kisses on my forehead

I'm almost 20, a sophomore in college and I've never dated. Most of the time I'm actually happy being single, and not too worried about it- it'll happen when it happens kind of thing. I go out to eat, and on little adventures by myself. But I feel like I'm too good at being by myself sometimes, especially at 19. Not that independence is a bad skill but..

Of course I was disappointed when I never got asked to a dance in high school, tho my best friend was kind enough to get my a corsage every year whether she had an actual date or not lol and the only date I've been on was with a boy I met at a weird birthday party junior year (I don't really know why I went bc I knew I didn't like boys but uh kinda turned into a good story lmao). I had two big crushes, one turned into my best friend and another I asked out senior year and it didn't go terribly? But talk about awkward:') but I honestly had bigger things to worry about so I didn't have too much time to spend on it

Apparently some of my friends had crushes on me, but they only told me after the fact. 

I got asked out by one girl freshman year of college for coffee over txt but it was kinda weird and set up by our friends and akskdj 
I guess I had a thing for this other girl first semester but it wasn't mutual and our friendship went wonky, but shes rly cool and was my first kiss (still never kissed anyone sober tho) 
I talked to someone at a nearby school for a while and thought things were going well until they sent me this weird txt abt how they felt like I liked them more than they liked me and our conversations kinda died out from there

And it just sucks having absolutely no experience. Not just sexual, but like the emotional experience too. And it gets worse every year. I don't even know what I'd do if someone liked me back, the prospect honestly scares me I think. And I'm the only one of my friends. They all have dated, most in highschool and pretty often hook up. Or make out w ppl at parties. Etc. And I apparently don't even realize when ppl r flirting w me according to my friends.

I don't often feel lonely, but nearly all my friends have dropped out/transferred and I only have two friends left this semester who I actually hang out w and one isn't coming back next semester and the other is busy w work/bf and isn't on campus. I'm trying to make new friends and try new things, but while I am joining new campus activities the friend part is not going especially well. I'm good at meeting friendly faces, but vibing is hard lol 
I have lots of friends, but they're spread out at different schools and we don't talk all the time, and see each other face to face like twice a year

While having someone to link up w a lot and just relax, and Like sounds nice I'm also torn bc being touch starved feels so much worse when u lose it vs never have it. Like, the girl I had a thing for last year was a very physical person, at least compared to me, and it fucked me up pretty bad when we stopped hanging out bc I had no idea how dependent I had become on her casual touch. And going through that again? And that was when we hung out regularly less than 6mo? Yeah no thanks. And they say the first break up is the worse, bc u have to learn how to deal w them and god I wish I could leave my firsts back in high school

It just feels like being on like one of those historical ball room floors where everyone around me is waltzing? And the dance gets more and more complicated? And I have no idea how to keep up or where any one learned the steps 

I'm a confident, put together person generally. I like being good at things. Knowing the [unspoken] rules (even if it's just to break them lmao). And relationships, even the prospect/crushes, put me off balance so bad that i find them pretty anxiety inducing. I want a relationship/life experience/feeling wanted, but they're also scary. I don't like being bad at things, and I don't want to go through missing physicality again- im not even very versed in platonic rejection, before college I never met anyone who didn't like me on some level. 

Even my mom has been telling me I 'deserve a special friend', and she didn't let me entertain the idea of dating until I could drive myself lol 
idk it's not just wanting a s.o it's a few other things (losing friends, fomo, vulnerability, fear of aging, etc etc etc) but its hitting harder rn. Like damn if u told 13 y/o me she'd have to wait for her first kiss until she was crossed in a grocery store parking lot at 18, and longer than 20 for a gf I think she'd be pretty pissed lol like 20 years could b a quarter of my life?

4978,How to make myself clear to a crush that I’m single and avaiable now?,"So, I recently ended my relationship.

And I have been receiving some mixed signals from a classmate. We are not friends but we sit close in the classroom. About 2 months ago she added me on facebook but since I had a girlfriend at that time, I didn’t even think about it.

Since then she has been “loving” all pictures of myself that I post. I saw her fb profile and found out she is at least Bi. I think this is intriguing

When I broke up with my now ex, I started following her on insta because it is easier to start some contact/flirting.

I have been posting lgbt things on my story just to make sure that she knows I’m gay (because I am femme and look straight 🤦🏻‍♀️) but I’m not sure if she knows that I’m single now

And don’t know how to make it clear without saying this directly. I wanted to be more subtle

She replied one of my stories this past week because she saw we are reading the same author and she wanted to maybe exchange some ideas about the book when we finish it

And keep “loving” my pictures.

Is she possibly interested?
And how do I show that I am now avaiable and could also be interested in getting to know her better?",actuallesbians,1579525060,iganu,,1,True,2020-01-20

5003,Flirting among lesbians,"So as we all know lesbians excel at flirting. Endless stares across the room, eye contact, smiling and repeat until one of them leaves or something. 
In my case, there is this other lesbian in my class, I didn't really had a crush on her last year but this year I'm low-key developing a crush on her, and apparently she's on the same path too. I promised myself not to fall in love with anyone this year cause I'm moving to the other side of the country and I don't want such a long distance relationship. But this is happening, and how do we let each other know?
Through our telepathic lesbian powers. Which translates into; she looks at me until I smile, then she smiles, then I do the same thing. Sometimes we talk, but that's for special occasions. And sometimes we even text each other and I think that's on the level of pre-marital sex or something cause I never thought we'd do anything apart from... You know... Looking at each other and smiling.
Being a lesbian is so weird like... I see straight couples flirting with each other every day but I can't even tell a girl how much I like her hoodie in case she's straight and she doesn't tell me and I start catching feelings, and planning our wedding, new house, moving in together, cat/dog...

5055,I'm a lesbian and I started hooking up with guys and I don't know why I'm doing this.,"Using a throwaway because...you get it. Also on mobile so forgive any errors 

I'm a lesbian, I've known this for over a decade and I've been out to the world for years. While it's not easy I'm comfortable with the identity and I'm not trying to change myself at all. But I started hooking up with guys. I don't feel attracted to them, and I don't even enjoy having sex with them. It started with a hookup that was supposed to be with a girl. She pulled the ""surprise here's my bf and he wants to join"". I've had this situation before and walked away but for some reason I was just fucked up enough to say ""fuck it"" and I let it happen. 

It wasn't good. I didn't feel good about it. But it doesn't seem to matter how I feel or what I want. I felt this weird sense of resignation during the whole thing, like an out of body experience? I remember before I agreed I thought ""oh well, none of this shit matters, might as well let this guy fuck me""

It happened a few more times with different guys. I made a seperate tinder account and obviously got flooded with messages so it's easier to find someone. I'm not sure if the dudes have gotten that much out of their time with me considering I'm not really into it. I don't know why I'm doing this. 

I'm struggling here. And I don't know how to put it into words. Like yes, I don't enjoy the sex, I'm not attracted to the person, I don't feel good about myself after, but I do it anyway because ??? 

Please. Can anyone help me make sense of this?",actuallesbians,1578806834,Throwaway23567914,,1,True,2020-01-12

I never dated anyone in hs or uni but in my last year of uni I met this girl in one of my classes. She was nice and it was fun to talk to her. We didn’t become best friends or anything like that. A few months after we graduated she dmed me on insta and asked me out of a date. I had no clue she was asking me out on a date and I said sure! We somehow dated for two years. I would consider her my first love. First everything really. 

I never thought about possibly being a lesbian. My family is super traditional so I grew up thinking I would marry a man one day. Ex dated men only before me. We never discussed our sexualities. I figured she liked me and I liked her. I was happy and thought everything was going well. She broke up with me. Maybe we didn’t click like I thought we did. 
 
It’s been two years. I know I shouldn’t be following her on social media but I still do. She got married on New Years to a man. I’m glad she’s happy. I sometimes miss being with her but I’ve moved on. 

I haven’t dated anyone seriously since that relationship didn’t work out. Not sure where to start. Do I want to be with a woman? Or am I straight? I hooked up with a guy last year and didn’t love it but I also had no feelings for him. Maybe that’s why I didn’t enjoy it as much? I’m 25 now and still have no clue who I want to date.

5067,Feeling upset because of a girl,"Hi all. I’m on mobile so I apologise if it is formatted weird.

I have had a crush on this girl (we’ll call her Daisy) since February of 2019. I did not think much of it because my feelings just come and go. Someone told her I had a crush on her and she started to make it seem like she liked me. She said how I was perfect for her and we made out. I was the first girl (and person, she’s bi) to kiss her. I never made any moves on her. She made advances to me. This made me infatuated with her.

She said she would totally date me but then backtracked. She told me she was confused about her feelings and needed time to think. She was still leading me on though. I called her out and said she can’t just lead me on when she’s confused. She said she was sorry and that she wanted to date me. I said okay, even though I was suspicious. After this she started being distance and I asked her what she wanted to be. She said just buddies and not more. I was heartbroken but I moved on and met someone else.

When I was dating my girlfriend (around mid Aprio) she would say things about how my girlfriend is a weirdo even though my girlfriend was very popular and well liked. I ignored it. Over the summer (July) my girlfriends family lost their home and had to move out of state. I was devastated. 

Me and Daisy were always best friends, but we got extremely close over the summer because she went through an emotionally difficult time. I was the only person there for her. When we would hang out she would be very flirtatious and touch my thighs and asked me to sit on her lap. 

Eventually, Daisy kissed me while we were in a park. I was confused but I went with it. After we made out, I saw her texting her friend about how it felt really wrong. I was annoyed but just decided not to do it again. The next day though, Daisy would flirt more with me and our relationship became sexual.

While our relationship is sexual, Daisy also tells me how she is in love with me and she never has felt the feelings she has felt with me for anybody else. She also doesn’t like when people touch me like she does or when I have sex with other people because it makes her jealous. We act like a couple except without the label. The thing is, she always tells me how she wants a boyfriend. I am so confused and hurt because I love her so much. I don’t like that our relationship doesn’t have label, whether it be we are exclusive or not. But I’m scared to initiate conversation because she had rejected me so many times.",actuallesbians,1578813054,butterflyrose123,,1,True,2020-01-12

5075,Dating advice? Girl from tinder is giving me mixed messages and I think I ruined it?,"I’m in my mid twenties and matched with another girl the same age in the same small town on tinder and we’ve been talking for about four days all day long and all night and it’s been great.

Neither of us (apparently) only want sex, we both want a relationship/to find someone, we have a lot of things in common and from what I know we both find each other attractive.

Two days ago she went out drinking with friends but was adamant she still wanted to message me which was fine. We were having a normal conversation and then all of a sudden she just kept sending really sexual messages so I just said “message me tomorrow, have a good night “ because I do actually wanna meet her and see how things go and I don’t just wanna be someone she sexts or whatever.

Then we carried on talking normally for another hour and then she kept asking me really sexual things again and I just said “I’m not really interested in talking to you like this” and she just said “I’m just drunk it doesn’t mean anything” so I replied “That’s not an excuse, I’m still a person and not someone you just message when you’re horny”

That was two days ago and she hasn’t replied at all and I think I’ve ruined things. It’s a shame because I feel like we definitely would’ve gotten on well in person and I would’ve loved to take her out on a proper date but her messages she was sending to me were “Come here and finger me” whilst she was out with her friends?? 

I don’t really know the point in this post I’m just kind of frustrated because I wanted to see how things go and I’m annoyed at her for only really wanting me for sex despite her saying she’s not, as well as at myself because I probably could have handled it better.

5081,I'm no longer sure,"I have always struggled with acknowledging and expressing my emotions because of past trauma and it's been a wild and tough ride but I'm hopeful I can do better this year. However, things have been particularly harder recently. My gf and I have been together for 4years &amp; 4mos and have been living together for 4yrs. As much as I appreciate the time and love we've shared, I'm getting confused and starting to question if it's really worth it at this point. We've struggled a lot to get where we are now. Unfortunately and embarrassingly, some of those struggles involved physical and emotional abuse from both parties (and cheating on her part). At this point, I'm no longer sure if the numbness I feel towards everything including her is because of extrinsic factors (my family is very abusive but that's a story for another time and it's been killing me since forever) or if it's because I just really no longer have the love I used to feel for her. We've been living like an old married couple where one works (me) and one takes care of the kids (her and in this case 2 dogs). I used to look forward to proposing to her (I started planning for it towards our 2nd anniversary) and living the rest of my life with her even with all the complications (we're living in an apartment owned by her parents who are homophobic and only knows that we're ""bffs""). I just really don't know what to do anymore.

5085,My crush is giving me mixed signals???,"So.. I'm a girl and my crush (who is also a girl) is (supposedly..) my best friend at school. I met her a few months ago (because I'm going to a new school) and we hit it off right from the start. We had so much in common and shared so many similar experiences that it was crazy. She was also the first person I came out to (and yes, she's also gay). Now.. a few weeks ago I left her a note when we had separate classes where I talked to her about my feelings for her. During recess I hid in the library because I was scared I had ruined everything. 20 minutes passed (that lunchbreak lasts 30 minutes) and I tell myself ""Okay. I hid here for quite a bit. Maybe I should head outside and go somewhere else."" (I was anxious, okay??) I step outside the school's library and start heading downstairs when guess what? She's walking up the stairs with a friend of hers. ""Shoot-"". We look at each other awkwardly and just say a really weird ""hi""?? I start walking faster but then she turns around, leaves her friend and says ""Hey, you. Come here."" I honestly felt sick at this point from my high stress levels. She was really upset. She didn't want a relationship at that time because she had been hurt a few months prior by another girl. But she was so sweet and told me ""You are everything a person could have asked for"". She was terribly upset and kept asking me ""You're good right?"" and ""You wanna talk about this more?"" and ""Our friendship remains the same, right?"". Fast forward to that week's Saturday. She came over to my house and after talking and doing stuff for a while she said ""Can I get a bit awkward?"" and I told her ""Sure, dude, go ahead"" (yeah, we call each other ""dude"" and ""my dude"" for fun). Then a conversation about my feelings towards her was initiated and she was totally cool. We talked about each other's perspective during the moment we met each other after she had read the note. She was pretty chill and admitted that she did have a crush on me at some point but when her crush of two years asked her on a date she just stopped? By the way, that crush of hers (which she had for two whole years) turned out to be a jerk and never actually felt something for my crush.

To make a long story short (I know I have written a lot but sshhh), she keeps giving me mixed signals. She hugs me. A lot. She puts her forehead against mine and looks at me. She randomly wants to hold my hand. She friggin calls me pretty. Like, a lot. Whenever we say goodbye she hugs me and there were a few occasions where she also kissed my shoulder and then said goodbye. Yesterday at my birthday party I purposely put some makeup on (it was the second time I had ever put makeup on, I'm not a huge fan) and I did it so I could impress her. When she walked into the restaurant and she saw me she was like ""Wow! Oh my God you look so pretty!"" and as we were walking towards the table she kissed my jawline from behind?? As we were walking??? and then during the party she played with another girl's hair and put her head on another girl's shoulder. She's so confusing! What can I do?

5095,I'm not sure if I'm being useless or she's really not that into me...,"I should say I suppose I'm not technically a useless lesbian, I just identify as queer, but I am generally pretty useless when it comes to dating and romance.  But I've sort of resolved to put myself out there more in hopes of finding a significant other, so to the dating apps I went...And I wound up meeting a pretty cool chick.  We had a lot in common, so I suggest we meet at a cool bar that's also a book store.  I meet her there and we have a drink and chat.  I seem to go really well.  We call it a relatively early night because she's tired from work (which I completely understand).  I offer to walk her to her car because she parked farther away from the bar then I did and I didn't want her to walk alone.  She seems fine with this, and while I'm not a super touchy-feely person (especially with people I don't know well), I don't think it's strange to at least share a hug after a date that's gone well.  But her body language seems to indicate she'd not be into that so I don't go for the hug...hey, everyone is comfortable with physical things at their own pace and when we were discussing sexuality (she brought it up) she seemed to indicate she might be more demisexual, which I'm perfectly fine with.

We talk the next day and she seems really warm and friendly via text and suggests we go out again to a restaurant she likes.  Once again we meet and we seem to have a good conversation.  She suggested a rather early time for dinner so I thought she might want to do something else after (and there was a movie theater around the corner), but when I bring that up that she sort of just changes the subject.   She then apologizes and says she's tired again (and I had specifically suggested a day where she didn't have to work to go out, even though I did and was running on very little sleep), so we get the check (which she insisted on paying because I had paid the previous time) and call it a night.  I casually start to walk her to her car again when she asks where I'm parked.  I point to my car (which is only a few spots down from hers) and she says, ""Ok, goodnight. I'll be in touch,"" and maybe it's just my imagination but she seemed to rush off to her car.

Now I'm terrible about gaging when someone likes me...but I can't help feel like she not into me at least at the end of dates.  Everything thing seems to be going great while we're out, and like I said she's super friendly and warm when we text (and she often texts me first) so I'm getting very mixed signals.  Sorry, this has been so long, I found typing this out cathartic more than anything.  It's just I'm tired of disappointing dates that go nowhere.

5101,Confused about my sexuality,"Hi everyone!

I'm looking for some advice... I (22) have been feeling more and more confused about my sexuality recently and I'm not sure how to handle it. I have always considered myself to be straight but have found myself very attracted to and fantasising about women. I'm unsure if this means that I am actually attracted to women because it's not women in general but a very specific type (androgynous, slim, tall). I have always tried to ignore this part of my sexuality because I don't know how I'd even begin to explore it, or if it's even valid. However, after being single for several months now, I'm starting to wonder if I should stop suppressing it.

The problem is that I know absolutely nothing about dating other women, let alone having sex with them. I'm worried that I'll be labelled a tourist for ""experimenting"", or that I'll end up hurting someone's feelings. I live in a small city with a relatively small LGBTQ scene.

We really haven't chatted much but have made mad eye contact.

At what point would it be good to ask her out (assuming I don't chicken right out)?
Should I try to talk to her more first, or just go for it? 

I'm worried if I just go for it the date might be awkward, but also worried if I wait for the right time to ask I will never ask.

5112,confused please help @ seasoned lesbians or folks who came out later in life,"I don’t know if I’m bisexual or gay. 
I really really want to be gay. I’ve never wanted anything more. I also have OCD so I obsess about my sexuality basically on the daily. 

Sometimes I’ll see a really beautiful dude and be like omg he’s so beautiful and get nervous about it or stare. But I don’t usually act on that. I also try and envision having sex w him and some parts are okay but other parts sorta gross me out and idk if its my past trauma or if I just don’t like sex with men all that much. My whole life when I was “straight” I felt too masc or ugly ever to date a guy (didn’t really have interest anyway) but I wonder if that played a role in it too and I just shut off any budding attraction idk. Part of my problem is that I get turned on when other people are turned on. So in the past knowing someone was turned on by me turned me on basically regardless.  I’m not sure I’ve ever felt the emotional aspect of having sex when I had sex with men, but I think physically I did get off and like enjoy some of the physical feelings. Recently I grew really fond of a male friend and honestly got jealous when he paid attention to other people and I’m wondering if that was a crush. 

My whole life I’ve only ever had like heart and thought consuming crushes on women. From when I was a young girl this has been the case. I wonder in part if it’s because I never let myself fantasize about boys or if I just never wanted to.  My only real relationships have been with women and I have been head over heels for them. It makes it hard because I grew up in a really religious home and was made to feel like acting “masculine” was disgusting and that sex between two women was also disgusting. So basically any time I have sex with women even though I enjoy it I struggle to get those out of my head and usually end up depressed after.  Whenever I’m in public my eyes follow women. If I see a cute girl my first thought is that I want her to look at me lol. In movies and shows I look only at women and basically daydream about being with a woman and having a cute wife.

So anyhow I’m pretty sure of my attraction to women. Not as sure of my attraction to men and I wish it wasn’t there, if it is truly there and isn’t comp het.",actuallesbians,1578845236,dazedandconfuzed27,,1,True,2020-01-12

5118,Can any Asians tell me their story of them coming out to their parents/family?,"Hi!

I am a Chinese American with Chinese Vietnamese immigrant parents. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here's a little backstory:

&amp;#x200B;

I (26/F) recently came to terms that I am, in fact, a lesbian back in like Sept 2019. I had boyfriends, I dated guys but never felt right... If anything, I always felt wrong after dates with them. Don't get me wrong, these guys were great! I thought if maybe I continue to date them I would somehow grow to be attractive to these guys, but never. After my last boyfriend of 2 years, I haven't been in a relationship in a hot min. I dated around but it never went further past the first date... I usually ghost them (I am an asshole).

 I went through a period where I was extremely depressed back when I was 23 or 24 years old, unsure of the reason behind it at the time. I pretty much had everything, so I was so confused on why I felt so empty. I never managed to really figure it out and chopped it up to me being unfilled career-wise. After a while, I felt fine and then towards the middle of 2019 I got depressed again. Again, I chopped it up to me being unhappy at my job, but this time I really took a step back to self reflect because there was nothing wrong with my job. I finally realized that I wasn't happy because I am not living my authentic self... I finally came to terms with this is who I am and I need to accept it in order for me to be happy.

I came out to one of my close friends during breakfast. It literally took everything in me to tell her that I was gay, but I felt the weight lifted from my shoulders. I have issues opening up to people and expressing my true emotion in general, which I am working on. 

Since then, I was on a mission to get my first date with a girl. I finally matched with a girl that I was interested in and we have been dating since mid-December. I still currently live with my parents (moving out in a couple of weeks). They have been noticing that I am staying out late and have been asking me if I have a boyfriend, which uncomfortably tell them no. They always reassure me that they won't be mad that I have a boyfriend, but in fact, are happy for me.  Even when I was dating guys, I still find it uncomfortable to talk to my parents about it... Anyways, I do want to tell my parents that I am gay but I am so scared of their reaction. I know, eventually, I would have to do it.

5121,I never realized when guys were hitting on me,"So I recently met a guy who I used to hang out with (he was a friend of my roommate's), and I remembered an interaction I had with him a few years back, which at the time I totally misinterpreted.

I was talking to him at a party, we were both a little drunk. At some point I told him I'd better get back to my friends, and he said something to the effect of ""but not before I get your number"". We'd been having a nice conversation, so I gave it to him. He texted me the next day and we had a relatively shallow text conversation. I don't remember how it ended, I just remember that I sent the last message, and so I was waiting for him to continue. Which he never did. At the time I thought it was a little strange, but I didn't think about it too much. A few months later, the two of us had a class together, and he acted extremely cold towards me and basically ignored me (which made the class hella awkward because, well... we knew each other, and the class was weekly). When I asked my roommate what was up, she said that he was mad at me because one day he saw me walking and I didn't greet him. I went ""well that's weird"" and basically never thought about it again.

Only literal YEARS later did I realize that he was hitting on me and was disappointed that I didn't show any interest. The thing is, I sort of *did* know at the time - logically I knew that he was probably flirting, but it felt unreal, like I was sort of making it up (not dissimilar from the way I *knew* I was only into women but somehow didn't realize I was a lesbian until years later).

Anyways, the point is that I sat across him at a friend's birthday party, remembered all this, and then proceeded to whisper all this to my girlfriend who was sitting next to me, and we had a good laugh.

Anyway I'm now incredibly excited because I guess I just realized there are more opportunities than I could have ever thought of (also not to be that person but wow how come everyone is so hot I would legit date them all sadabgwkdgqwi) but I'm also really scared because I NEVER used a dating app before?

Of course there are other factors in these relationships, but I’m starting to see a trend. Whenever I date cis lesbians, I find that they want me to be more feminine (some have even pressured me to wear makeup more often or wear lingerie). Almost every one has left me for someone more feminine and who’s cis identifying. Recently, my non-binary ex left me for their co-worker who is cis and super feminine as well. It felt like a knife in the back from someone who’s similar (and presents even more masculine than me). I’m devastated. It feels like no one will ever accept both halves of me.

I try to take my pooch to the dog park when I can and Friday was a nice day out and I had the day off so off we went.

My dog is not a super common breed so sometimes people stop me to ask questions about her. That day, a man noticed her breed, and was asking some questions. He seemed nice and friendly until we hear two dogs barking like crazy. Like most dog parks, this one has a small dog and large dog area that are separated by a fence. A pomeranian and a husky were running back and forth across the fence and barking at each other. Not unusual dog park behavior at all. 

The man turns to face them and then basically spits out, ""those DYKES don't know what they're doing and they shouldn't own a dog."" 

It was so nasty it immediately made me full stop. I was shocked by the venom in his voice and the full 180. I know people can be nasty and homophobic comments are not rare but it caught me by surprise. Before I could say anything he was off with his dog, but I've been stewing about this since.

5137,I want..,"I want a girl that loves watching movies while cuddling together, loving similar actresses so we can thirst over them together, making bets about who'll win in the next awards, staying up late to watch said awards trying not to fall asleep. I want someone with whom I can go on long walks in the evening, going out at night and watching the stars while we drink hot coccoa. Someone that'll let me draw her at any moment and take pictures of her. I want to sit in our bedroom and chill while listening to music and having deep convos about any topic. I want someone to whom I can say random facts and they'd never get tired of me, and them to do the same with me. I want someone to hug from the back while they're cooking, or working or basically doing anything. I want someone to be a dork with, I want to throw pillows at her, tickle her, make her laugh by making funny faces and the worst puns ever. I want to go on adventures together, week-end road trips to the mountains or to big cities, anywhere as long as it's with her. I want to travel, I want to see the world with her, learn about new cultures, do improvised dates in the most beautiful places on Earth. I want to share clothes so we can remember each other when we're far away. If that happens I'd text her everyday, just to make sure that she's okay and asking her to text whenever she wants. Then I'd just let her enjoy her time while I spend time wearing her shirts and hoodies. There would be need to be overprotective because we'd trust each other with our lives. 

I want to know her body so well that I could draw all her moles, freckles and birth marks as stars in a constellation. I want her to enjoy every second with me and me to enjoy every second with her. I want her to be free and do anything she sets her mind to because I'll be there to support her no matter what. I want her to know that I'll be there to catch her, so she shouldn't be afraid of falling. I want her to enjoy life, to smile, laugh, cry, get surprised, learn... And I want to be there when she does all that. I want to know her ambitions, her biggest fears, her favorite things, her deepest thoughts... I want to fall in love with her personality. 

I don't want there to be uncomfortable silences between us. Every silence would be an opportunity to look at her and learn more and more, we'd make staring contests just so I could see her soul through her eyes and know that that's the girl of my dreams, the girl I want to spend my life with. The ups, the downs and the middles, nothing would tear us apart because we'd always sort everything out. I don't want her to feel bad about herself, even though she will somedays, as well as I will, but I will be there to hug her and make sure that she knows that everything gets better and that in my eyes, she's the most perfect girl I've ever met. I just want her to know that I'm there, and that I'll always be there.

5139,Will I regret having never dated in college?,"Basically, I just...havent. I kinda figured that I only liked girls back in freshman year, but was mainly focused on school and didnt think dating was important (I was never the best student in high school and I was a much better student in college, but probably to the detriment of my social life :/ ). Every so often, I thought about putting myself out there, but I'm not out to my parents and they are Always in my business and always seem to know what I've been doing/who I've been with someway,somehow. (It was the same when I lived at home, and I thought they'd lay off once I was in college, but it's the same and college is almost over anyway). I plan on leaving the state, but until then they're always in my business.

I guess the more accurate question is how is the lesbian dating scene after college? I'm one of two in my friend group (all LGBT funny enough) who havent ever dated (I obviously couldn't date in high school). I know a relationship isn't everything (and I should be worried about my post college career), but I'd like to be in at least one Haha

5145,"How to meet girls: I have a possible answer to the ""useless lesbian"" dilemma!","A common problem among WLW seems to be being too shy or oblivious to signals to meet women. Thinking back, I've realized a common thread in my past meetings that lead to relationships. 

The wingman/wingwoman!

I'm a married (to a cis male) bisexual and I've had several WLW relationships over the years. Just to cllarify, we're not unicorn hunters and my husband is not involved with my female friends, beyond friendship, and I'm always open with my female partners that he is my primary relationship. I treat them as real, complete human beings and not as sexual accessories (a sensitive topic in this subreddit for good reason).

Anyway, I'm almost always unable to know when a woman is interested in me, for some reason. I guess I can't determine the difference between ""I like you"" and ""I *like* you"". LOL

My first girlfriend was introduced to me by my female roommate. That girlfriend, after our relationship fizzled, introduced me to my next. Haha

My husband has often walked to me from across the bar to inform me the girl I was just chatting with was into me. Many times he's done this (last night in fact), and I've always been oblivious and he's always been correct.

I think it's sometimes easier for a third party to see someones body language when they're not the one involved in the conversation. Also, I always seem to miss the obvious cues like dilated pupils or playing with her hair. 

Anyway, if possible, find a wingman/wingwoman. Confide in them that you're looking to meet new people, but not great at meeting them. It isn't the ultimate answer for everyone, but worth trying if you can.

So many people seem to lead you on, then just never talk to you again. When you start to feel a genuine connection, they just break contact and unmatch with you.

Just feeling a bit of hope and happiness practically prepares you to feel so empty and alone days after.

5159,What do I do after a first date?,"Hi! Feel free to skip to the end.

This weekend I went on a date with a girl I matched with on Tinder. We went for drinks and it was great albeit a little awkward - she ended up saying she’d never been on a date before and I told her this was my first date with a girl so we were both equally nervous. We left the bar after a couple of hours and once I got to my house (she didn’t intentionally walk me home but we live the same way) we very awkwardly said it was a good date and that it was nice meeting.

Later I texted asking if she made it home alright and gave her my snap (and my number) since we had been talking through Tinder up until that point. After adding each other neither of us has messaged the other in over a day.

I’ve never dated a girl so I’ve been overthinking absolutely everything. I’ve had awkward dates with guys but usually we still go back to theirs and cuddle/ we’d text the next day but since she hinted that she’s looking for a relationship I was scared to come off too strongly by asking if she wanted to watch a movie in my room or something.

Basically,

If she hasn’t messaged me does that mean she probably isn’t interested in seeing me again? If I text her what should I say? What would be a good 2nd date for a broke uni student?",actuallesbians,1578869473,mistarreis,,1,True,2020-01-12

5163,first relationship?!,"every time me and my best friend (at uni) got drunk we’d end up making out, and we’d do a lot of cuddling n watching movies and she’d sleep in my bed and stuff but somehow i convinced myself it was platonic bc i didn’t want to catch feelings in case they weren’t reciprocated / i’d just catch feelings and never act on them and then the friendship would be weird
then like a week before the end of the semester i started to admit to myself i may have some non platonic feelings for her, and then 2 days before the end of the semester she told me she liked me and i said i think i like her too, and we said we’d go on a date . then the next day we did that and then i kissed her sober for the first time
i really like her a lot, i’m just nervous bc i’ve never been in a relationship before whereas she’s already had one that lasted over 3 years, and also this sounds weird but i’m nervous she likes me more than i like her because i probably wouldn’t have asked her out, but once she did i thought... yeah that would make sense because i think i do have some feelings.... but i think i just repressed them so much that i didn’t actually know what i wanted. so i guess i’m just nervous about ruining a friendship incase our dynamic doesn’t work as well if we’re dating! but to be fair, we acted like a couple before anyway and people would always mistake us for a couple/ask if we were dating ‘yet’ lol

5167,At what point do you assess if you're better off as friends?,"I'm seeing someone. We've had several dates and we still haven't really kissed. She turns her face away pretty quickly after our quick peck every time. So I sense she doesn't want to. I haven't talked to her about this since we don't see each other that often (LDR). I just feel a barrier is up emotionally and physically and I'm not sure what to do. I like her but I don't know what's going on with her. I don't feel as if we're at the stage where I can ask her where we are or anything. I really liked her at one point but I find my interest dissipating and I sense hers is too. She stopped texting good morning and good night awhile ago. She has taken longer to reply back. There have been less romantic messages (some still present but not as often as before). 

 Honestly, I don't feel like we're making any progress as a couple (not only romantically but emotionally).  The thing is I feel like I still don't know her and I don't know what to do about that? In my previous relationships/dating experiences, there was a pretty strong connection really quickly and we opened up to each other. They were also pretty quick to text back, sweet talkers, and I was more certain? The thing is, none of those relationships/experiences went well or were healthy. They were also overly cocky girls... and I know this one is shy.

5190,Confused about girl I matched with..,"Just a quick intro before gay panicking: I’m a 22-year-old queer woman. The last time I’ve been with another girl was over 8 years ago. Religious parents found out about her and weren’t happy, so I’ve been dating men since then to be in good terms with them.. but I know that I would much rather be with a woman and don’t care much for others’ approval nowadays. I’m single now and wish to meet a cool girl.

Anyway, I downloaded this LGBT dating app called “Taimi” last week and have since then matched with numerous women. However, out of all of these matches, there’s only been ONE girl who I’m constantly chatting with and really enjoy talking to.

Unlike other girls I’ve matched with, she can carry a conversation very well and asks me questions all the time instead of just talking about herself. She shows genuine interest in me. We get along very well since we have the same humor and interests. I find her attractive and have started to develop a crush on this girl.

About two days ago, she said we should hang out, and obviously, I said yes! I told her which city I’m in, and she said that’s like an hour-drive away, but she said she totally wouldn’t mind the drive to see me. We planned to go to an arcade first and then a bar after. I was over the moon.

Here’s the issue, though.. I’ve complimented her on her appearance and style a few times, but I just realized that she seems to get uncomfortable and changes the subject to something else. She hasn’t complimented me back, nor has she shown she’s physically attracted to me. 

What really got me is that we were talking about sports, and I mentioned that I thought she looked athletic and that I couldn’t relate (I know, bad self-deprecating joke). I talked about how I tried to upload full body pics to my profile the other day, but the app wouldn’t process them (which is true). Joked about taking it as sign of some sort. She said it was a crappy move on the app and we started to talk about video games.

Later, I realized that I had the option to actually send her full-body pics directly in chat. So I sent her two pics and explain to her that I found a way to upload them. Btw, these were completely modest photos. They were outdoor shots were I was dressed casually and a family member had taken the photos. I am 5’6” and a US size 16.. she knew about my size beforehand.

After a few minutes, she sends me some messages, but continues to talk to me about video games. Completely ignores my photos. I felt like such a moron for sending them in the first place.

This happened a few hours ago, and I haven’t responded since because I’m in a state of confusion and honestly a little offended. I don’t know if this girl just wants to be friends or if she’s actually interested in dating me, because her profile states that she’s looking for dates and I personally wouldn’t travel an hour away for someone I’m not interested in.

Obviously, I’d respect her decision if all she wanted to be was friends. I just don’t know what to do from her. Any advice, ladies?

Thank you in advance!

TLDR: Been talking to a girl on a dating app for about a week, we get along well and she invited me to hang out, but she’s showing signs of not being physically attracted to me.

5197,I'm pretty sure I've been (accidentally) creepy for years,"I'm on mobile...sorry if formatting is off.

(Background details) I grew up in a religious family, and being gay just wasn't a thing. The mindset imposed on me through most of my teen years was this: no one is actually gay - people just *believe* they are.

Growing up, girls would catch my eye all the time. Yet, I was so deluded by my religious beliefs that for the longest time my attraction to girls simply didn't register. I didn't understand that, from afar, I was experiencing romantic feelings for girls and women. It also takes a while for me to develop sexual feelings for a person (I'm demisexual), so that made it all the more difficult to understand my sexuality.

I finally realized I was attracted to women when I was 18, one year after I began thinking for myself and accepting the queer community. It was a shock, and a relief. It made a lot of sense. My mind and heart was freed - no longer clouded by my old beliefs. 

Here's why I mention all this...

I lived in complete denial that I was staring at girls, and occasionally acting giddy and even flirtatious around them. I thought I was a straight girl; I couldn't possibly be creepy. I'm not super outgoing, so it probably wasn't as obvious as those sentences make it out to be. Still, I might have made some girls (and women) uncomfortable without realizing it.

What really sucks is that sometimes, I still catch myself staring at women when it isn't appropriate (I'm almost 21 now). I have to continually remind myself that just because I'm not a straight male doesn't mean I'm exempt from creepy behavior! 
Also, just because I'm a quiet introvert doesn't mean my behavior goes unseen! I like women, and I need to like women responsibly.

Ack.  Just had to vent. 

I hope all this makes sense. 

----

TL;DR I didn't know I liked women for the longest time, so I didn't hold myself accountable for creepy behavior (like staring at girls).

5199,is this weird??,"Okay so i need an opinion. I am a 17 year old female high school senior and I won't be 18 until July. I have been texting and flirting with a 15 year old female freshman at my school. I've been very reluctant because of the whole freshman/senior thing and have made a point of how weird it is. However, my feelings are growing. I still feel gross about it even though it's only a 2 year age gap. I even told her that I am gonna stopping talking to her once I turn 18 in July because I don't wanna be 18 dating a 15 year old. She would turn 16 three months later though. I'm starting to develop deep feelings for her but I just still feel weird. So my question is... Do you think the age difference is creepy?? Should I continue to entertain the fling?? Am i justified in ending things when I turn 18 despite her turning 16 three months later??",actuallesbians,1578884490,airvixen3,,1,True,2020-01-12

He's not like this for gay men (less representation here so I haven't really seen his reaction much) and straight people (I've literally seen full on nudity filled s*x scenes in movies that he chose for movie night). I think he's like this bc he thinks of lesbian-ism as an explicitly sexual thing as he mainly sees it in porn and stuff like that.

My new girl doesn't like penetration (that's fine) and it's difficult to bring her to orgasm with clitoral stimulation. I've only brought her orgasm twice with my hands and it's not like I was doing anything different that time. Thing is she had this ex who could get her off every. time. with oral sex by sucking on her clit. She can also get off with a vibrator or shower head.

5210,My girlfriend broke up with me a few weeks ago and now she's with someone else. I need to rant.,"I feel like utter shit right now. My girlfriend of 7 months broke up with me in December. It was amicable and we're still friends, but she's gotten with a mutual friend of ours and I feel absolutely worthless.

I became homeless a few months into our relationship and she took me in, that was around October. For a while, things were going fine, but then everything started going to shit for the both of us. She broke up with me right before her birthday where I had something special planned. Since it wasn't inherently romantic, we still did it, but I still felt like shit. 

I noticed right around the turn of the new year she started hanging out with a mutual friend of ours constantly. As it turns out, a couple weeks after our relationship ended, she started dating him. I feel completely inadequate compared to him, he has basically everything I don't and I feel completely discarded even though that isn't what she wanted to do to me. I talked to her for an hour or two just before I'm writing this and she confirmed that.

I still want to be friends with both of them. I already have almost no friends and no supports, so if I lose them I'm basically fucked anyways. I don't know what to do. I feel utterly worthless and unneeded, like my life just isn't meaningful to anyone. I just really don't want to be lonely. I was so lonely before we got together and now I'm just back to where I was.


Everyone always abandons me. I don't have parents or family because they're both dead, and even if they weren't, they still would've abandoned me because I'm trans. After they died I went to go live with my childhood friend and his family, but it was clear from a few months in that they don't actually like me that much. They ended up getting kicked out because their landlord was a piece of shit who got upset because they missed one payment once. They're looking for a place now and they said they're willing to take me back, but before any of that, they'd already told both me and my childhood friend that we would be kicked out in a year, so I'm not convinced they're actually going to take me back. Even my time here at my ex's house is limited, they only know they're going to be here until august, and after that it's unclear what's going to happen. 
I'm so utterly fucked in life. I just want to give up entirely, none of this feels worth it. I wish I was just a cis woman, none of this would've happened if I were just a cis woman from the start. That's the only thing I've ever wanted in life and I'm never going to be able to get it.

5214,Books Growing up,"It took me a while to figure out I was gay. In my head being a lesbian just wasn’t an option. It was boys or end up alone. 


I think one reason it took me a while was because of the books I read. They all had similar themes. Some badass chick (spy, criminal, ect) goes on an adventure and saves the world. And I can say for sure that one reason I read them was because I wanted to be those girls. Live their adventures and have amazing powers or talents.

But always in these teen novels the girl falls for a boy. Or maybe two boys fight over the girl. But in the end, girl and boy end up together in the end. 

During my teens, I knew lesbians existed but that just wasn’t me. Lesbians existed in porn but not in a romantic, everyday, lifestyle.  But looking back, I understand why I never thought it was an option for me. It was never really introduced to me another choice. I thought my life was just like the girls in my book, it was this guy or that guy. That’s it. 

If only there had been a bad ass teen novel about a girl who falls for another girl. Or hell give me a bi chick who must chose between a male and female romantic interest.  Even today, I have difficulties finding books with wlw characters that peak my interest and make me want to read for hours like I did as a child.

I'm in a somewhat liberal area, but the pool of WLW is still relatively low and I'm non-monogamous (but single) so it narrow it even farther.

I walk into the strip club last night with a decent stack, stood by the stage and tip the girls, asked at least six dancers for a dance, all of them said okay... and then none of them came over, lol.

Yet I literally watch at least a couple of them try to talk to guys who they realized eventually wouldn't pay them anything. 

I realize maybe they were just trying to make better money then they thought they could pull with me, but it's just like, damn. I'm so starved of touch, sex, intimacy with women, and to feel like you can't even pay women to touch you is a little soul crushing.

5223,"I thought I was a lesbian, but maybe I'm not. I went on a date with a guy, but I don't like dick????","Hii, I have identified as a lesbian since 6th grade. Now that I'm 18 and with a little bit more freedom, I decided going further than I have with anyone and try to pursue a romantic relationship. I have had zero luck with girls on tinder. Additionally, I live with my mom, and when I tried to come out in freshman year, it was a shit show. I convinced her that it was just a phase, and that I'm straight. So, I had an identity crisis and set my tinder profile to show boys as well. I went on a date or two with one boy, and he really likes me. We've made out a bit, which I was fine with. But now I'm confused. I don't have a crush on him. My heart doesn't flutter the way it does when I was flirting with a girl. Yet, I've found that I've gotten along with him more than I have with any other girl. But I couldn't see myself touching his dick. 

I know this passage is all over the place, but my point is, I thought I was a lesbian, and that I could hide my identity from my mother. Then, basically like two seconds ago, I thought I could try to experiment with a boy to see if I could change, and not be a disappointment to my mom. This guy is really nice. He treats me with so much respect, more than any girl ever has. But now I think things might be getting more serious, because he wants me to meet his friends. I don't want things to go too far if I haven't figured out my sexuality yet. I can see myself flirting with him, going on cute dates, etc. But I could never imagine myself having sex with a guy.

5254,Please stop saying how much we look like a couple,"I know we do, and you don't know how much a secretly love hearing those words fall from your lips. How quickly it's becoming not enough. I am too logical, too technical, to know what to do with the warmth I get from waking up next to you. I don't know how to deal with feeling of love in my chest and fingertips becoming too much to handle as you lie across my lap watching TV. I swore off letting my heart open a while ago and have never known how to let me feeling run freely. Loving you, my best friend, has quickly become too much and entirely not enough. Please stop saying how much we look like a couple I hate it I hate it I- I hate how much I love it.

Sorry for the angsty venting. Backstory is that my best friend and I just went on a weekend trip together and I am usually soo much better at swallowing my emotions than this. Don't worry she is also gay as fuck, so I guess at least I didn't fall for a straight girl.

5257,People suck. I hate men. I'm buying a Hitachi and deleting tinder,"So I was FWB with a guy for about a year. We were friends first but I've day decided to *cough* help each other out. But he got a job offer and just... left. Now he's not even messaging me back. Ok I get it, but it just seemed odd. Mean *we're friends*, but whatever, it's his life.

Tinder sucks. Plenty of Fish sucks. Unicorn hunters suck. I've been offered money for sex, blowjobs, caming, ""photo shoots"", and one guy wanted me to ""be his new Mommy.""

Fucking Christ people. Buy me dinner first at least.

Then, I start hanging out with a girl from work. She's.... breathtaking. We were at my house and I'm complaining about my bra. We start complaining about bras in general and how hard it is to get a good fit. We're both busty and she offers to help measure me. I'm thinking ""I'm living a bad lesbian porno! OMG my shirt is off....OMG she touching them...,"" aaaaand nothing. We took measurements and shopped online for 2 hours. Lots of touching and I was topless for 3/4 of it but nothing happened. I apologized because I thought I made her uncomfortable. ""Uncomfortable? Nah, we're both girls. It's not like something was going to happen.""

😐💥🔫

THEN I try posting in r4r. Nothing dirty gust wanting to chat. I post F4F thinking that'll filter out some of the guys....nope. it was up for 4 hours. I got over 20 messages from guys ""just wanting to chat.""

I *did* get a message from a girl that seemed fun to talk to. We chatted and flirted for several days. We even sexted and traded porn. Then I did something stupid, I sent a nude (just boobs). She sent back a picture of ""her""....it was a famous porn star.

I have to sound like a ""man hating lesbian"" but I'm just over it. The stupid thing is **I'M BI**. Look, Im attracted to guys, I do butt stuff, I have big boobs....I just want to be treated with respect. That's it. Just don't be an asshole.

5258,Things that helped us on our journey to find our sexuality or gender identity.,"One of them for me, was when I first heard, ""I'm a lesbian trapped in a man's body."", said by Eddie Izzard (at some point), I don't know if it was from a friend, or someone on TV commenting on it, or even some dude-bro saying it in a funny, ""hahaha, lesbians"" kind of way. What I do remember is lightbulb going off in my head, telling me that is why I am different. I knew that if I was a cis woman, instead of trans, I would be a lesbian, no ifs ands or buts. It wasn't until many years after that where I learned the language to express who I am, that I have always been a woman. In many ways I am thankful for hearing that quote from Eddie Izzard. I know the quote has become a bit loaded and has been used as a form of lesbian erasure, or to devalue who we are as queer women, but to a young trans lesbian it was a life-saver in that it made me feel like I wasn't alone. 

Have any other women had this kind of experience, where a quote or book, or presenter helped solidify their gender or sexual identity? I would love to hear our different stories, if you want to share.

5264,My ex-girlfriend(27F) is being confused about getting back together. She does not want to get back but she wants to meet me and keep in touch with me. I (25F) love her so much. I do not what to do anymore. I am dying in this condition.,"  

We both are females and we were in serious relationship for two years. We had a strong connection and were very close. I had to move to another city for job two months ago and problems arose. After a lot of arguments, my girlfriend broke up with me. It was a hard work for her cuz she texted me for like a week after breaking up. I apologized and begged her for a week to not break up. But she said she couldn't stand the long distance and the fights.She suggested to stay as friends after breakup and I refused. She said I am the one she broke up with love and she is trying to get over me. We got really busy when we were distant and kind of lost the emotional connection although we met once a week according to our schedules. Before I moved, I will quit the job if she cannot stand the long distance and will move in with me. She is not ready yet to live with me and does not want me quit just for her. So I decided to work there for like one year and will quit the job later. We managed to overcome this after a year. I stopped contacting her when she said not to contact anymore. It was after two weeks of our breakup. I felt like I was dying and cried everyday. After 5days of no contact, she texted me and checked on me. I told her to get back again and she refused. I asked her to stay as friends cause I cannot seem to live without her. I felt relief just to receive a word from her. The next day, she texted me and said the luggage she ordered for me had arrived and she can deliver it to me. I replied to give it to me on weekend when I come back the city. She asked me to contact her when I get back. I texted her when I am back to city and she picked me up and we had dinner yesterday. We talked like friends and she sometimes brought up about after breakup situations. She cared for me like she used to be and she asked me whether I have met new connections with other girls. I said I am alone and trying to find happiness with myself. She also said she is alone and sometimes misses me because of many memories. During our meetup, I never talked about getting back together although I am hoping it on my mind. She dropped me at my house and before I leave, asked me what is my opinion on getting back together. I said I still have feelings for her but it takes both of ours effort to work it out and to not happen the same problems. I said I am willing to give it a try. But she said she is confused to get back together or not and is scared of the long distance and the same problems will happen again. She is okay with this situation except she misses me sometimes. Finally, she said she will not get back. I told her we should not contact or meet anymore then to move on and she said she still wants to talk sometimes. She asked for a hug and we both cried while hugging. She gets my hopes high and let me down. We made a nice goodbye. Later on that night, she texted me and asked if I like the luggage. We chatted again. I confirmed her that we will not meet anymore but she said she wants to meet me and she will come to me tomorrow evening after her work. I cannot stay by ignoring her when she texts me. Although I am hurt, I am expecting that if I meet her more, I have higher chance to get back her. I don't force or push her to get back but my mind is not decisive to move on or not. I got hurt like hell after breakup and I think she still texts and tries to meet me cause she is not over yet. She means the world to me and since our breakup three weeks ago, I don't feel the same anymore. My life seems meaningless. I want to get off this weighting from my chest. I do not know how to continue anymore. She broke up with me but she is not leaving me for real. But she cannot get back with me too. I cannot live by ignoring her too. Can we be improved if I continue talking and meeting her? I wanna know how to live calm and relax in these conditions.",actuallesbians,1578929119,meemeestar1995,,1,True,2020-01-13

I was just reading an article section on people who transition when they were married, and it got me to thinking. I'm a trans woman, bisexual who leans extremely heavily into same sex attraction, but also feels a certain degree of sexual/romantic attraction for men. Reading that article made me realize something. 

I don't think I could stay with a partner who discovered they were FTM trans. I don't date men for a number of reasons, and am adameantly against it for myself. I genuinely do not want to be in a relationship with a man or male aligned person, and even less desire to spend my life with one despite being bi. I want a wife, to spend my life with a woman, and to grow old in a sapphic relationship. Finding out my partner was actually a man, wanted to transition, and blowing up that dream would hurt far more than I could say and it would devestate the hell out of me. I couldn't and wouldn't stay.

I've met a girl online and was surprised at our click. I'm extremely picky, so I was glad that we connected on so many levels. Two weeks ago we met irl and we had that same click!! She likes me a lot and I like her a lot and I'm really excited to see where this is going, and this week I'll be sleeping over after hanging out (we live about 1 &amp;1/2 hours apart) and I guess I'm just looking for some tips??

5296,Lesbian deathbed,"So me and this girl have been seeing each other for quite some time now I'm not even sure if I can call her my 'girlfriend'. I had several bed partners before I started a ''relationship'' with her. I like to keep it exciting, to try new things, it doesn't always have to be soft and sweet for me. I am very open-minded in terms of sex and I have no trouble talking about it. I easily indicate what I like and what less.  My girlfriend has had just a one-bed partner for me. This was her ex with whom she spent a year. She says little about this relationship, I only know that they did not see each other often, that they were too different to live with each other. 

She did tell me that on a sexual level at the end of the relationship things had happened that she did not feel comfortable with. There was no longer any emotional bond between them, but her ex wanted sex. My girlfriend didn't like this, she describes it as ""something that degraded her.""  I soon noticed that my girlfriend is a bit prudish in bed. Prey has a negative connotation and I don't mean it that way, but I don't find another suitable word. 

She is just less open than me. At the beginning of our relationship, she found it very difficult to talk about sex, while I was very open about it, I soon realized that she could not keep up with me, that I had to take it easy. In the meantime, she dares to say what she likes and dislikes.  But try something new? No, that is not possible.  The first time I bought a sex toy for us, she almost crawled under shame. In the meantime, she thinks it's okay to use this, but this always happens on my initiative. I have to say, if we have sex, she will let herself go completely. She is not at all cautious at that moment. The sex is really good too.  But it always goes the same way. When I focus on something new, she suddenly seems shy, or she starts to laugh very loudly, so I don't feel like trying.

5307,I’m in love with my best friend and don’t know what to do. Any guidance?,"
This is my very first post, I hope I’m doing it right! I am a 21 year old (F) college student in the US. I think I’m bisexual (I’ve never even written this down before, that’s how new and scary it is to me), but I only started really viewing women romantically within the time I’ve known the girl I’m going to talk about. Anyway, I’m in love with my best friend. It’s complicated and I’m not sure what advice I’m even asking, maybe just general guidance on how to move forward or if anyone else has been in a similar situation? I’ll try to explain below. 

We met about a year and a half ago, while we were both studying abroad for a semester at the same university. She is incredible! I won’t go into too much detail here, but she is absolutely beautiful and the smartest and most talented person I have ever met in my life. She’s lesbian, but very very lowkey in a way that she assumes people kind of know this about her already. We bonded over mutual interests and became inseparable. I realized I had feelings for her about a month into the semester. We’ve always been... close. We always have to be near each other or even touching and often get into our own little side conversations at parties to the point where we stop paying attention to the other people in the room. When we get drunk, other things, uh, happen. We hold hands, we dance very very close to each other, and on two occasions, we’ve kissed. Our friends have noticed some of these behaviors, and often point out that we are much closer to each other than to anyone else. Random people have noticed, too. On multiple occasions we’ve been told we’re a cute couple and a guy at a gay bar once whispered to me how lucky I was to have her as my partner. A friend of mine also asked me if I had feelings for her (I lied and said no, obviously). We both equally shoot very serious “I love you” in text/phone calls and face to face conversation A LOT. 

There are several problems with this. For one, that semester ended a year ago, and we now attend our regular universities in our home states 1,200 miles away from each other. I’ve seen her two times since the semester ended. She surprised me on my birthday by flying to my state, and we also met back in the same city we studied at. This might sound promising, BUT both times we were also with our other friends from the study abroad, so she didn’t just come to see me (although we were side by side pretty much the entire time). We still chat almost everyday, but she’s not super into social media or texting so we call each other about once every other week. She desperately wants me to come visit her in her home state, so much so that she is trying to give me money for a plane ticket. She also wants me to move in with her. 

The biggest thing, however. is that I don’t know if the feelings are mutual. I’m not sure if I’m the one that’s being overly friendly and she’s just going along with it,

I am so afraid to even bring this up with her, especially when I’m so unsure. I do not want jeopardize our friendship in anyway because I really love being her friend and I’m not sure what I’d do if I didn’t have her. But, at the same time, I’m going to go crazy eventually if I don’t try and figure this out. I am head over heals in love with her and I just don’t know where to go from here.

Well, I thought I was bi for a long time but idk a few months ago I realized that I was never interested in men actually... I started to doubt my sexuality but I didn't feel completely secure about being a lesbian 

I was pretty scared of wrong labelling and my fear was that I tell everyone I'm lesbian and then in a few years I fall in love with a man BUT now I know even if this would happen IT DOESN'T MATTER AT ALL and now I feel secure to say: I'M GAY 

A few minutes ago I told my only friend who knew I was bi and I knew that she would love my outing because she always told me that I don't like men

5328,"I made out with a drunk coworker who has a boyfriend. She doesn’t remember, should I tell her?","Maybe a post more for a relationship sub but I felt like I need some advice from you ladies.

I’m 19F (lesbian) and my coworker is 22F (bisexual). We are friends, often going out after work for drinks and mini golf with a few others. We also message each other fairly often.

She’s been having some issues with her boyfriend. He is dealing with depression and has started to isolate himself from her. They haven’t had a proper conversation in months now. She has ranted to me many times about this.

Anyway, we had our work away day last month which ended up with us in a club. She was very drunk. The whole buildup is so cheesy, Katy Perry’s ‘I kissed a girl’ came on and I pulled out a cherry chapstick which I always have on me (it tastes amazing!). Since I was holding it I proceeded to put it on. My coworker giggled and then told me to “kiss her already”.  I was a little hesitant as she is in a relationship, but it was so hard not to since I have a bit of a crush on her. She kept leaning in so I gave in and we started to make out. I broke the kiss to remind her that she was technically still in a relationship. She laughed before saying “not as far as I’m aware” and continued the kiss.

Cut to last week when I met up with her for drinks, the first time since the away day. She’s still with her boyfriend, but the situation is very similar, she hasn’t spoken to or seen him in a long time now. She doesn’t remember a thing from the away day, which I’m not surprised about since she was so drunk.

But I feel guilty. I know I didn’t initiate anything and she insisted it was ok at the time, but I still feel terrible. I don’t know whether or not to tell her what happened. I don’t even know if I’d want to know had I been in her shoes. And I’m scared I will ruin our friendship, and I kind of like her too so I’m worried that I’ll make things so awkward for both of us.

Problem is she’s straight as can be. I found myself earlier today talking about good looking football players with her even though I’m gay af and have literally zero interest in male football players. I think part of it is I just want to have something to talk to her about, but also I’m so used to straight girls immediately assuming I’m into them when I say I’m gay and pushing away which puts a damper on our friendship. But in this case I AM into her, so I guess part of it also is like “well if I pretend I’m straight she’ll never know I’m gay” and won’t push away. I have no problem with her knowing I’m gay, I just don’t want her knowing I’m gay antd into her, ya know?

5334,"We’re both into each other, but too scared to make the first move. Pls help :(","I’ll start with some backstory. My friend (we’ll say Louise as her name) and I have been friends since high school. Louise and I have similar backgrounds with overly-religious and neglectful parents so when we met, we clicked instantly. We actually met through my (now ex) boyfriend at a Tegan&amp;Sarah concert. During the concert, we ran away together and had our own fun, completely away from the rest of the group. I held her hand, and we sang and danced together all night. That was maybe 6 years ago, and it’s one of my fondest memories. Since then we do a lot of things together, and they’re basically dates...we call each other babe and will “pretend” to be their partner if a guy starts hitting on us. 
To be honest, I never stop thinking about her and I haven’t since I met her. She’s everything I want in a person. We both have been confused about our sexuality, with Louise coming to terms with hers much much later than mine. I’ve had relationships with women, I’ve slept with women, and I have more experience with the same sex than she does. Years ago, I shot my shot with her. She politely turned me down (I was drunk when I asked her) and we remained very close friends. I think me asking her out started her realization that she’s into women too, because after that she became more and more flirty with me. There was a time when I had to tell her not to flirt with me unless she actually meant it, because I have feelings for her and I don’t like being toyed with. She then admitted to me that she has feelings for me too. We are both scared to make the first move at this point, because we have such a strong friendship. Also, we are both sort of seeing other people at this time. What I want to do is be with her. I want to make her happy, I want to call her mine, I want to wake up next to her every morning. 
Basically, what I think I’m getting at is, how do you take the first step from friends into lovers/partners ?

But if I block her, I worry about what could happen with my relationships with other people that know/follow her. They are my friends, they're not bad people, they simply don't know her the way I do so they couldn't really understand and I don't want to give up on them/having to block them too just because of 1 person. But at the same time I really want to get rid of this toxic presence in my life. I want to feel free to post everything I want without having to worry about her reactions. I really don't know what to do...

I've had a similar situation happen to me in the past and after I blocked that person, some of her friends tried to contact me asking me why I blocked her. Thankfully they were all people I didn't know so I just blocked them and moved on with my life, everything going fine, but this time it's different because I feel more people could reach out to me and it would be really complicated having to explain the whole situation, especially because the girl in question has really shitty mental health so I am honestly terrified at the thought of whatever she could do (but at the same time I can't keep ignoring MY OWN mental health, which is far more important). And I know I could handle this by simply blocking everyone else that knows her too but it just feels so...unfair and shitty! Because those people appreciate me and have always been kind to me and I honestly have no reason to block them if not in fear of what she might tell them that I would then have to deal with just to ruin my days.

Should I wait some time and not use my account and then once everything there was between us has completely fizzled out block her, or should I do it sooner and pray nothing too complicated will happen? 

I hate the situation I'm in right now because I love my account a whole lot and I don't want to suffer like this just because of 1 person. I don't want to stop using my account.

Which makes sense. I'm from the south in a very country area that's not real LGBT friendly.

It seems like if you're not apart of the community you can't find them in my area.

she would do it non stop every day and she wouldn’t be discreet about it at all. i’ve spoken to her a few times but the staring started before we spoke. 

i overheard she has a boyfriend too but i just find it a bit weird because it’s not like she’s glaring at me or she hates me. i honestly can’t pinpoint how she stares at me because it’s a mixture of a lot of things. 

it’s also a lot more than staring too i’ve noticed. i won’t get into specifics because it’ll be too much but let’s just say at some points i was certain she might find me attractive but i don’t know. the boyfriend thing throws me off a lot.

5370,Dear Future Wife,"Dear future wife,

I love you. There is nothing more simple yet more profound than these three little words. I simply cannot say it enough, I. Love. You. 

I love waking up next to you, especially on a cold winter day. When I feel the chill first thing in the morning, I move closer to you and rest my head against your skin. I watch your chest rise as you breathe peacefully in your sleep. I kiss your neck gently, being careful not to wake you. Words cannot express how content I feel next to you. 

Future wife, I never knew what it meant to be captivated by another soul so utterly and completely, until I met you. I have studied your smile, your eyes, lips, hands, every curve of your body, and I have failed to find a part of you that I don’t utterly and completely love. I love your zest for life, your ambition, your creativity, and your passion to help those in need.  Truly you are a woman of another kind. 

Yet, there is something I need to confess. 

You know about my past struggles, but you don’t know how these demons still affect me. It’s like there are two opposing forces in my life, one part that wants to run and find solitude in my faith, the other part that wants to love you fiercely and wholeheartedly, to shout at the top of my lungs how much I love you. 

I wish I didn’t have to hide, I wish I didn’t struggle with the theology that loving you is a sin. I’m afraid I will struggle with this for the rest of my life.

But... I confess...

...it is a shame I never met you. I chose not to be brave. I chose to live a life that conforms to the religious norms of my family and faith. Instead of finding my purpose in loving you, I Consented  silently to let our future die. 


Your presence was supposed to be the sun that shines through a stormy afternoon. The dreams I had for us have blown away like clouds carried off by the wind. There is no silver lining for me. All that is left is darkness. 

I humbly ask for your forgiveness. I am sorry that I couldn’t love you the way you deserved to be loved. As you lay in bed, on that cold winter day, I hope that she is next to you, admiring your every breath. I hope she loves the way your eyes brighten when you find delight in the simple things of life. I hope she kisses you everyday as if her life depended on it. I hope she loves the sound of your laughter, so much so that it makes her heart skip a beat. 

I write to you so you may know that I will never forget you. I will never stop dreaming of you. I will never stop thinking of you. Where every you are in the world, what ever path you may take in life, know this, I love you. 

Love always,
The one that could have been.",actuallesbians,1578984644,FayQ1989,,1,True,2020-01-14

It got to the point where I couldn’t orgasm without watching it. My current girlfriend is the only partner that I’ve been with that has been able to bring me to an orgasm. And even that took like a year into our relationship. My problem is that it takes me so long to get there. Like I probably get her off within 10 minutes, but it takes me like atleast 30. I just get so in my head during it and I feel that I’m close, but my body won’t let go. I just wanna know how to be able to orgasm faster lol. I know it’s mostly mental, but no matter how hard I try to just focus on how good it feels, my anxiety kicks in and I start getting side tracked. It also doesn’t help that when I don’t orgasm she takes it personally. However if I take too long to orgasm I feel bad because I can tell she gets tired. I would be tired too.

5378,not sure where to start with dating,"19 y/o trans sapphic (im not sure if i'm bi or lesbian but i definitely prefer women) feeling lost and confused about dating

i live in a college town in the Pacific Northwest and there's predictably a lot of queer people, but i haven't had any luck with dating whatsoever. in high school i was really closed off emotionally and i didn't date anyone. i'm in my 2nd year of college here and i just feel like i keep running out of luck in terms of the dating pool here

i've tried using apps and whatnot, i got a couple dates with this one girl out of them but she ended up just wanting to be friends, which i 100% respect but it still kinda hurt. i constantly feel very alone and socially isolated in terms of friends here, as i'm friendly with a lot of the queer community but don't quite feel like quite i fit in and i get left out of a lot of stuff (even if it was better than high school in terms of finding like-minded and interested LGBT+ ppl). i think having a partner would really help out with this a lot, but i just keep feeling like i'm flunking out in terms of dating

i think partially this could be that i get nervous really really easily, especially around cute girls, as i don't really tend to pass all that well in these situations. i know some trans girls/transfems here too but since i'm either really close friends (but just fine with being friends) with them or on kinda weird-ish to negative terms with some i don't think it would be easy for me to date into that small pool. in terms of cis girls i tend to have more luck but most of the times it just goes nowhere (partially because of other reasons, such as them ending up being straight or me being really bad at flirting). i admittedly don't know many trans guys/transmascs, and there's the occasional cis boy i find cute but im still undecided if its just that i think he's a good friend or if i want something more. 

i guess my question is: how do i launch from here? i'm such a big sloppy romantic but boy am i so awkward and ashamed to really date people, especially girls. i grew up fairly sheltered, especially more than my friends here so i always feel like i'm really immature and emotionally stunted compared to the rest of them. i know it's perfectly normal for a 19 year old to have never dated but in this tight knit queer community here it seems like everyone is in a relationship of sorts (note: a lot of people i know are poly but i'm not sure if that's something i would be into, especially for my first relationship) so i feel really isolated and fragile.  what do i do? do i just become a nun? wandering trans girl sapphic just looking for some tenderness and compassion",actuallesbians,1578987452,angolmois666,,1,True,2020-01-14

I just want them to be happy and excited for me, is that too much to ask??? I didn't think it would bother me but I just suddenly feel really angry.

5383,I wish dating came with a relationship trial period,"So obviously the first few weeks/months of dating someone is when you decide if you wanna be in a relationship with them. And those first few weeks/months are usually really fun/exciting/scary, BUT also usually both parties are not displaying a true picture of themselves. You're still holding back certain information, habits or behaviours and trying to portray the best image of yourself.

I wish it was possible to have a 2 week ""trial period"" where you can see, if you did get into a relationship with this person what it would actually be like. What would living with them and everyday life with them be like?

And then after 2 weeks you either decide:
Yes - and then start the dating period
No - and it's as if you never knew each other

* Whenever people ask me where I'm from, it always confuses me. I was born in Vancouver, BC but grew up in Europe and Australia. Currently I'm in Asia but I'm looking to move back to Canada. If you're in Canada, maybe we can be roommates? 

* I love to explore, be it new places or new theories. Anything! I'm passionately curious and I love to learn.

* I am quite reserved at the beginning but once I get comfortable with people, I can't shut my mouth.

* I live a sober lifestyle, but I'm not pretentious. If you occasionally smoke weed or drink, it's a non-issue. If you pop pills and smoke meth, hard pass.

* I'm extroverted, tender-hearted, affectionate, and confident. 

* Fascinated by the morbid side of life, my curiosity is very commonly piqued by things that make others squirm. I'm not squeamish by a long shot. I'm intrigued by occultism, satanism, witchcraft, spirituality, voodoo, and all sorts of things that society deems ""weird.""

* I'm obsessed with playing pool, cards, board games, and music. 

* You know those people that are always down for whatever? That's me. 3am roadtrip? Down. New restaurant 4 hours away? Let's do it. Star-gazing? Okay! I'm the type of person that would rather say ""that was fun"" instead of ""I wish I would have done that.""

* I always have some sort of project I'm working on, so if you're too busy to talk, don't worry! I can find ways to occupy my time.

* I'd love to go full time on my creative ventures, but the whole starving artist thing isn't appealing to me so I'm a bookkeeper for a few different businesses my family owns. 

Anyways, enough about me. If I sound like someone you'd be interested in getting to know, drop me a line!  Please be at least 25. Nothing against younger peeps, I just connect better with people my age or older.",actuallesbians,1578998815,Q0807159,,1,True,2020-01-14

5401,My problem with this girl,"Well, i've heard that falling for a girl who lives far away is lesbian culture, and if that's true, i guess i've immersed myself in the culture!

Let me explain, i am 16F. I live near toronto, in canada. so i met this girl (15, almost 16F) in a twitter gc, and we just really clicked. we talked all the time, would joke about getting married all the time, and she's just so gorgeous and funny and magical and she genuinely makes me feel good. we really get each other and we're both so supportive of each other, and she's been like my rock when i got hacked and outed. we were always really flirty with each other, and she was always really affectionate with me specifically. so i decided to tell her how i felt about her.

&amp;#x200B;

 it was basically like, she was just so heartbroken, because long distance hadn't worked out for her in the past, and she wasn't really prepared to go into it again. but like, i have family in new jersey where she lives. so we started planning to meet up, and it might happen around march break!  


so we're not really in a place where we can date at the moment, but we're kind of like, crushing? i don't know? and i'm going to visit my family on march break anyways so i could get to see her. and she said she might get to a place where she could handle long distance.

&amp;#x200B;

but i'm scared that i'm replaceable, you know? like, i live a half day's train ride away, but what if she finds a skinny white girl with a jersey accent and hoop earrings and a lot of highlighter and a hot chip addiction and falls in love with her? like my friends say she's lucky to have me, but i'm so scared that she'll find someone to replace me and i'll become a memory. also, i wrote a poem about her but i'm scared to show her at the moment.

so, yeah, that's my dilemma! do any of you older, wiser sapphics have any advice for me?

5403,"Self conscious of Inexperience, performance anxiety?","I’m a virgin and I’ve only ever kissed two girls (pecked). I’ve tried dating and it hasn’t really gone anywhere and I wanted to save my first time for a relationship, however that doesn’t seem likely to happen any time soon. Part of the reason I was gonna wait to a relationship is because I have performance anxiety about being able to please my partner and if in the case I can’t make her cum then she might be nice about it compared to a hook up. (Logical? I don’t know). But I’ve been talking to this girl from a dating app and she’s probably the only girl who has tried to have full on proper conversations - I’m talking staying up texting late everyday, texting throughout the day, asks me questions etc. But she doesn’t want to meet for a date since she just got out of a relationship which is fair. However she has hinted that she would be happy to ‘Netflix and chill’ 

I’m not sure whether I should give it a try since I am self conscious of my lack of experience and it might be a good way to give it a try with someone I have some form of connection with. But I worry because I feel that since it’s my first time doing things I associate with dating , I’ll end up hurt because it will just be a meaningless hookup for her.",actuallesbians,1579003422,thr0wnawaythr0waway,,1,True,2020-01-14

5405,I need advice please.,"Long story short, my gf has been sexually distant towards me for the last 5 6 years. We moved into a new house start December, and since then we only had sex once. I am an extremely high libido woman whereas she isn't. At all. 


We are both going to therapy, individual and as a couple, she just won't help me out (if you know what i mean). She has depression and had suicidal thoughts and I've supported her as mich as i possibly could. 


I need to have intimacy in my relationship. This is killing me inside. And if i talk to her about it, she becomes even more distant.

5408,Bi-sexual &amp; bi-romantic without a place,"I am bisexual. 
Or at least, I think so. I might be pansexual. 
I'm born and raised in a country that is so free from bigotry and homophobes (they do exist here, of course, but they're nowhere near as loud as the lgbtq+ community, and they don't try to be) that I've never felt the need to come out or identify as something or other. I'm just me. A human being, that happens to like other human beings and I don't much care what goes on in their pants, I can probably work with whatever's down there. 

4 out of the 5 of my blood family are queer, only my dad stands out as cis-hetero, so I never had this huge moment of realization, or the fear of someone finding out, or bullying and rejection after the fact. I was just always me. No one really cared. 

Because of this I don't really feel like I can actually call myself a member of the lgbtq+ community. I've never had to go through all the trauma and awfulness and bigotry and wrongful hatred that many of you have had to deal with. I've never had to rise up from the ashes of that and be proud of my sexuality, because the simple fact is that...I don't care about my sexuality. 

It's not some huge part of my identity. It's just like my left little finger. It's there. It has it's purpose. But I don't really think about it. I'm not proud of it, or ashamed of it. It's just there. 

I know I am so incredibly lucky. 
I really do. 
And I am so proud of all of you for everything you've managed to get through that's been flung your way due to the sheer ignorance of others.

I have pursued this subreddit for a number of months and have seen some examples of cis/trans lesbian relationships that actually exist, so I know there are at least two or three happy couples in the world, maybe more! What I have noticed, though, is that these couple tend to be younger (20s and 30s) .  In my limited wlw experience as an older (62) post-op, very passable transwoman is that while I am readily accepted socially by my cis-lesbian friends, dating has been a complete zero.

5442,Advice Needed: telling our 3rd roommate about our new relationship,"Hi! Would love for some advice from this sub :)

My girlfriend and I (both 23) have been roommates for a year and a half, and started dating almost two months ago (lol a classic). We were best friends beforehand and have a third roommate (23F) who were also close to. We haven’t told her that we’re now a couple because we wanted to figure out our own relationship first. Now that we know it’s serious, we know we need to tell her. 

We have no idea how to do this without making things weird. We’re not too concerned about a negative reaction to us being gay, but she will definitely be shocked because she knows both of us as two “very straight” women. Neither of us have openly dated women before, and we’ve spent a lot of time previously talking to her about boys we’ve dated, using dating apps to find guys, etc. We’ve both known we are bisexual, but it was never something we told her. 

Does anyone have any advice for bringing this up to her? Has anyone else gone through this and can offer some words of wisdom to help make this less stressful??? We want her to know that she’s still our friend and we’ll remain lowkey when we’re around her, but I would love to be able to go to sleep in my girlfriends room without having to sneak around.

5445,Advice about which girl,"Cross post warning.

I've always been a lurker here, offering my insights and wisdom where I can, but never asking about anything myself. Well, a situation has come up that I need advice of my lesbian community on here. I haven't even told my IRL friends because I really don't know how to feel about it. Anonymous advice sometimes the best! So I apologize for the long post but hopefully you will stick with me. 

A couple months ago I met a girl on a dating app. Was actually the first person who messaged me when I signed up. It was an instant connection. I have had a number of long term relationships, I am in my 30s, so I have been around the block and am able to recognize a true connection and the difference. We chatted all day every day. The compatibility was very clear. So after a week of this we went on our first date. And ladies, it was an amazing first date. Probably the best I've ever had. We had about three weeks of intense dates and conversations, was going amazing. She couldn't even go a whole day without seeing me. Would sometimes just stop by for 20 minutes on her way home from work. Just to see me. Then suddenly out of the blue, she just stopped responding well to my messages. It was sporadic and perfunctory. Two days of this I called her out on it because it was such an abrupt change. She assured me there was nothing to worry about, she just needed some alone time. Which struck me as odd because it seemed a bit early in the affair to need alone time. Sure enough, the next day she messages me to say she needs to end it. That I am amazing, nothing I have done, but something is missing on her side. DEVASTATION. Especially considering all the things she said prior to that and what I could quite obviously see in her eyes. 

So I pick up the broken pieces of my heart and attempt to move on. A couple weeks after this, a girl online starts messaging me. I respond because why not. We actually live really far from each other, so I figured this was a nice and safe way to ""meet"" someone, especially so soon after that last disaster. And hey, if things did progress, they would be slow. And progress they did. We seemed to have a lot in common and be pretty compatible. Have been chatting with her for a few weeks. Even gotten to the point that by summer she wants me to take a trip and visit her. Definitely feeling a bit hesitant though as some trust in girls and what they say to me has been broken. 

Then yesterday, when I go outside to my car, I find a letter under my wiper. It's from the original girl. Three pages long. She's apologizing profusely for her behavior. Saying how she got extremely scared of how intense things were and believing that she could possibly be happy. How much she misses me and that she doesn't expect me to give her a second chance after she turned tail and ran out of fear but that she really hopes I can forgive her and try again. 

So, to the advice. Do I open my heart again, take a risk and try again with the girl I know that we have an amazing connection, one I haven't ever felt before and give her another chance. Or do I continue to chat with the sweet, nice and safe girl that seems pretty compatible so far, but that would be long distance, running the risk of having no chemistry or attraction in person.",actuallesbians,1579030852,ReyesTynil,,1,True,2020-01-14

5463,The first cis lesbian I've let touch me in years is treating me like an actual dating prospect,"I met her on the Her app. We're both construction workers, her drywall, me an ironworker. I was so sure she was going to stand me up, it was getting late at the bar we were going to meet at and she was out with friends. When I told her I was heading home she immediately called me with her address and I went over. We hadn't talked about me being trans, she didn't know, just handed me some cigarettes and told me whatever I wanted in the house was mine. Mexican hospitality. 

We talked about unionism and her life back in Mexico and beauty. Smoked a little, cuddled. I gave her my jacket when she shivered, but ever the gentleman, she gave it back.

We're back in her room, and my transness still hasn't come up. I'm in a strange place in my transition, I pass but I can't control when, people read me as a cis woman, transfeminine, transmasculine, I have androgyny that's hard for people to read. She's a long haired dapper butch, and getting toppish. I'm backing off when she reaches out and grabs me. Pulls me close in such a way that there's no hiding what I am.

Without skipping a beat she tells me, ""You know you're beautiful anyways, right?"" And kisses me, hard. I think she's trying to take my lip off. 

She's a top, she's a very good top. I end up stroking her back after until she falls asleep while she holds me, and in the morning when I get up to leave she asks where I'm going, then pulls me back into bed and it's a half hour of kissing before I get out the door. 

I'm stunned. She wants to see me again. She tells me all the dykes in my past who treated me like a man, or a sexual experiment, or a dirty secret are fools for not seeing my beauty, inside and out. She's the first cis lesbian, first butch, first top I haven't run away from out of fear or real rejection, and I'm going to see her again tonight when she gets off.

5476,Is it weird to not want a relationship?,"I told this girl that likes me that I’ve been friends with for months that I basically like her too, but I’m not ready for a relationship or anything right now I just have too much going on and I’m not emotionally available for one. She got very upset with me, so I told her we could at least try going on a date or something even though, like I said, I was hesitant to do so bc I’m just not ready for dating/relationships rn. 

I ended up telling her today that I really just can’t get into anything like that right now, and she got even more upset and essentially said that I led her on, I’m too confusing for her to deal with, and I shouldn’t talk to her anymore. I was hoping that she’d understand but I guess not. I don’t really feel like I led her on bc I told her previously how I felt. I think I should feel like I’m an asshole rn but I don’t feel much of anything at this point. I was honest with her and I don’t see how I was in the wrong, I can see how she’d be hurt and I completely understand that, I guess I just wish that she could see my point of view as well.

I don’t think there’s anything wrong with not wanting a relationship at the moment, I’m able to accept that I’m not ready for that right now, but I still feel bad for some of reason.",actuallesbians,1579045287,TruMu92,Gay and a bit anti-social,1,True,2020-01-14

5487,I run a community for queer women and have a question about non-binary inclusion,"I run an online and in-person community aimed at queer women with about 400 members. It has the word women in the title, but we are also inclusive of “femme-identified people” meaning non-binary people who are on the femme end of the spectrum. In-person events include women’s circles, sex parties and social events. 

Yesterday I reached out to some trans and non-binary members I’m close to and wanted to check in with them to see if they felt included and if there was anything I could be doing differently. This lead to one non-binary member going on a long rant about how the group is sometimes “overbearingly feminine” and not actually inclusive of non-binary people and that they have been thinking of leaving for a while, so now they are gone. 

I’m just wondering that if you are non-binary person who dates women, how would you like to feel included in a queer women’s community?

I know sexualty fluidity is a thing,  I know sexuality is a spectrum with a lot of nuance,  a lot of grey areas,  exceptions,  and can indeed shift over time due to life,  time,  age,  or other factors,  but what gets me is that if you don't treat everyone' sexuality as always malleable you get looked down on.

5511,My Girlfriends Mum is Great,"So when I was a kid I was abused by my mother which led to a custody battle in which my dad won 100% custody of me, now I am a bit older and I still hold a massive dislike towards my mother and I seriously dislike it when any of the girlfriends my dad has had attempt to be a mother figure for me because as far as I am concerned I do not need a mother, however there is part of me that still wants a mother figure who loves me and cares for me.

 Over the past month my girlfriends mum has become a sort of mother figure for me, while me and my girlfriend were on the phone she asked to talk to me for a minute and told me that she and her whole family all love me and think I am an amazing person and then she thanked me for making her daughter so happy and for always being there for her, this reduced me to tears.

 In addition to this on New Years Eve (I spent this at my girlfriends house) she came over and gave me multiple long hugs saying the same things and some others that were also heart warming.

I thought I would never find another mother figure who I would accept due to my negative association with mothers but I think I have, on top of this my girlfriends grandmother has said to my girlfriend that she really likes me and thinks I am lovely,my girlfriends family being so loving of me has just made me really happy and I just wanted to rant about it.",actuallesbians,1578357876,kaeda2002,,1,True,2020-01-06

I mean why do celebrity crushes have to be singers or actresses? I am looking for my scientist crush. Help me find her :p",actuallesbians,1578371769,randomperson_asdf,,1,True,2020-01-06
5540,How do I deal with internalized homophobia and being invalidated?,"Hey guys, I decided to post this because I’m having a really hard time trying to accept myself for being lesbian. I’ve been trying to be at ease with myself, but the people around me end up invalidating me, which makes me feel terrible for who I am. I know that there isn’t actually anything wrong with being a lesbian, but I can’t help but think about how my life would be if I was straight. I don’t know any other lesbians around me and I’m feeling pretty lonely to be honest. I don’t know what to do.",actuallesbians,1578371941,BigGayvibes,,1,True,2020-01-06
5541,"I thought I was ace because I don't feel attraction to men, but really I'm just GAYYYYY (TLDR at bottom)","So a couple days ago I came out on here as asexual and I thought that I had everything figured out. My friend said ""the way you reacted to guys isn't asexual, it's lesbian."" She based this off of me saying girls are hot in the past. And I said ""no, of course not! I am NOT a lesbian!"" But then I began to think about it. 

I always chose who to like. I was 4, and I chose a boy to like. I liked him for 8 years, and when he finally went to ask me out, I ignored him. I went home, confused. I had wanted that for so long, and I was happy that I had avoided it. My friend said a boy liked me. I said he was ok, and she assumed that I liked him. They essentially placed me into a relationship, and I was an asshole to him to make him go away. In 6th grade a boy liked me, and I thought he was nice and cute, but he was really a ""safe"" choice. He ended up asking me to the dance, and I was an asshole to him too. In 8th grade, I had been flirting with a boy for 2 years. I kissed him on the cheek while on a school trip, and he tried to return it. Instead, I kept walking with his face on mine LMFAO. 

In high school, I liked one guy. I still occasionally feel bad about him because we didn't end up being together. But honestly if we did, I probably would have ruined it. Honestly with men, I was always like ""I won't marry this guy so why even date him.'' It's like who would I marry then because I was being so picky. Other guys I liked were choices that were safe or downright impossible. It was insane how crazy I went for these boys I wasn't even attracted to. Idk wtf I would have done if they did actually like me.

There was another guy that I actually dated in freshman year. He had beautiful green eyes. I liked flirting with him (as I did with other guys), but as soon as we actually started going out, I got scared. We were together 6 months, and I fucking hated it literally after the second day. I used to think I was at least romantically attracted to him, but kissing was awkward. I thought I didn't want to have sex with him because I was young, but I recently dated someone for like a week (I'm 18), and the mere suggestion of a penis made me nauseous. I was waiting for him to kiss me for the first time, but I realized I didn't even give a fuck if he did. And I hated holding hands with him in public too.  I thought I just had a problem I'd get through, which is why I thought I was ace. I thought my lack of attraction to men meant a lack of attraction to everyone, but I don't know if this is true. Also with that relationship, I was already repulsed by him, and I told him I liked him because that's when I expected that we should progress, which is dumb but comp het be like that.

I've never had an official crush on a girl. But when I was young, I always just acted like I thought certain boys were hot (Nick is still the best Jonas brother tho, don't @ me). I thought that Lavagirl, Elastagirl, Mirage, JADE AND SAM and shit like that was cool, not the bland ass boy bands. I didn't understand the obsession with boys. I was tomboyish and everyone hated me. I hated how these other masculine girls were considered cool because they were good at sports. I played too, but I wasn't as good as them and I hated it. I wanted to impress them so badly. 

I always thought masculine girls were hot. I still thought I was straight because they ""look like boys."" I literally didn't remember this until I saw some lesbian vid that said ""let me tell you about this girl I met at camp,"" and it hit me like a truck. When I was 12 there was one girl at camp who had short hair, and I thought she looked like Augustus Waters. I told my friend, and she thought she was hot too. And we acted like it was fine because she looks like a guy LMFAO. 

I always question being lesbian or bi because I still think some guys are cute. But now I know I cannot tolerate a relationship with a man, and I am just idealizing it. I also often like older men or celebrities, because they are unattainable. Last night I had a dream about marrying a celebrity, and I was at my wedding with him and I was so happy.  I can't even make it that far with a man, though. The Am I a Lesbian masterdoc seriously opened my eyes and made me realize the truth about myself. There was so much I was blatantly ignoring because of what I was taught.

I AM GAY!!! And I am scared. I don't know what to do now. I guess I'll go to the LGBTQ club at my school. My family is homophobic though, so I won't come out until I am 1000% sure I am into women. I don't want to say shit and then retract it so they can be like HAAAA ITS A PHASE.

TLDR: I liked flirting with guys but I never commit to them because I am disgusted!! When I did commit I yeeted myself from that shit quickly! I also had no interest in relationships and didn't understand all of the fuss about boys. I have finally come to terms that I cannot tolerate a man for the rest of my life. THIS IS IT CHIEF.

5545,Bridesmaid dress feels wrong?,"So, I’m a bridesmaid for my cousin’s wedding coming up, and she’s decided all the bridesmaids are going to wear the same dress. It’s a beautiful dress and goes well with the gown she’ll be wearing, but every time I think about wearing it, I get a bad feeling in my stomach. These past couple of years, I’ve really come into my own in both my sexuality and identity, and it’s been over a year since I’ve worn a dress/skirt (which doesn’t seem like a long time, but it’s one of those “past the point of no return” things).

My cousin is truly one of the most accepting and kindhearted people, so I’m sure if I talked to her about how I’m feeling, she’d want to help and let me wear what I’m comfortable in, but I’m debating whether I should even bring it up because it’s her moment and it’s just one day.  I can stick it out, but again, it just doesn’t feel right. Wondering if anyone else has dealt with similar situations and how you handled it.

5550,A thank you note to all my sisters here,"Hi

I'm a 23 year old trans girl from India. I wanted to thank all of you for helping me get through the most difficult stage in my life. I am autistic, Schizophrenic and in words of someone who used to date me 'the purveyor of misery onto the world'. 
I want you all to know this sub has stopped me from killing myself multiple times... Even yesterday when I was about to overdose on my brother's amphetamines... You are the reason I'm alive right now and I can't thank you enough for that (although my existence is a pain that never seems to get better)
As a person who has suffered rape multiple times, having gone through conversation therapy that pumped me with testosterone and God knows what, being that one person who nobody wants to hang out with, it is very hard for me to find reasons to live. I usually drown this by writing poems and hurting myself and crying myself to sleep
This sub and r/traaa give me a sense of community that I desperately need. 

I don't know how to flirt or do any of the basic things needed in a romantic relationship, but I yearn for having someone to talk to and hug when I am sad and cuddle all night listening to Andrea Gibson's poems... I guess that it is something I'd never have and honestly, I am terrified about living because of that... But this sub sometimes makes me hope that someday, I will find someone.

I already had a suicide note written thanking all of you but I guess I'll scrap that for now.

Please don't ask me to promise not to hurt myself and to get rid of the thoughts of ending my life... For that matter, don't be surprised if I do end up doing it because that's all I think about these days...

Thank you for being that one silk thread that keeps this pile of horribleness that I am from dropping down into the abyss of death

I am eternally grateful for your existence

Yours in lesbianness,

5558,My (24F) girlfriend (25F) wants to have sex with guys. I'm out of sorts.,"We have been together for 6 years. Now my girl is the type to say “we don't need men!” and is pretty negative regarding men so I never thought we'd be having this conversation.


For starters I thought and honestly still do believe we have have a great sex life, always using anything a lesbian can use for sex. Recently though she told me wanted to try sex with a man, my first question was “are you still lesbian!?” she said of course but she just wants to try. I asked if she maybe just wanted a bigger dildo or was I not using said dildo correctly, was the sex not great? Not eating you out good enough? want even more toys? I was just asking anything that came to mind. She said we could do a threesome and I responded with “what do you mean WE? I've never showed any interest in men!” she said well what if she just hooked up with guys and I won't consider it cheating since I know she's lesbian. She also mentioned that some stuff she wants to try just can't be done using a toy, like giving a blowjob or experimenting with semen. That stuck with me. Girls who give blowjobs usually say “I like it because he likes it” so why would a lesbian like it!?


The next day we were just laying on the couch scrolling through Instagram and she goes “Henry Cavill is hot” now I understand you can appreciate someones attractiveness without necessarily being attracted to them, I've even heard my straight brother mentioned another guy was good looking, but the timing of her comment about him messed with me. I don't know what do now, I'm not even sure if she's still lesbian. She says she definitely still wants to be in this relationship but I don't know how to feel about this.

I’m a lesbian who’s more masculine of center, from my haircut to the way I walk to the clothes I wear.

5569,how I met my new GF / future wife,"Every year my school lets students from different schools come and follow a day in school and I saw this really shy and a bit scared girl hiding. She was really pretty but I was afraid to ask her name by the end of the day and i didn't think i would see her again. When the school asked me if I wanted someone to live with me I thought it wouldn't be that bad and so I asked them who will be living with me it was that shy girl. I was overjoyed with the news and I cleaned out her room that I had been using for storage that evening.

Since September (she is a year younger than me). in the first month, she avoided everyone I brought back with me to hang out. she used to get bullied really badly in her last school so that is why she is really far from home. 

During the second month, she trusted me enough to wear her really cute to downright sexy cosplays around the apartment. I got turned on by some and others made me want to hug her and never let go.

In December she was trying really hard to be flirty with me. I was a bit down after she said she was planning on going home for Christmas but I was happy too that she has a really great family to go back too. On the 19th she tried to buy her plane ticket to go home but there weren't any that would get her home in time so she stayed with me.

On Christmas Day, I held a party with everyone and she really tried to enjoy herself but I could see she was really nervous. After everyone had left I realized that she is the perfect girl for me and my drunk ass kissed her and put my tongue in her mouth and honestly it was one of the best kisses I have had. She looked really surprised and after the kiss, she ran to her room covering her face, she was really embarrassed by the kiss and didn't spoke with me the next day.

A week later she was walking around in a cute catgirl maid outfit, I could barely look at her without getting turned on. During that evening we were watching my favorite movie and i laid my head on her lap and it was really comfortable. she really seemed to enjoy the movie and after the movie, she confessed her feelings and i was so happy that I didn't sleep that night. The next morning we went on a date and made it official with really cute rose gold rings with our names engraved on the inside.(i know it's really fast but I honestly couldn't hold my feelings back any longer)

yesterday she caught me masturbating to one of her pictures and instead of being mad she looked happy and she closed my door. In the evening it was my turn to make dinner so I made her favorite meal(I asked her mother for the recipe). After dinner, she pulled me into her room and she looked really nervous and we talked for a bit about her still being a virgin and after a bit, she asked me to fuck her and I thought of it as a bit too fast but she really wanted me to and it was the best night I have had in my life. She is really submissive and her pussy is really tight. 

I left my diary in her room this morning and told her she could read it while I was out shopping with my friends. When I got back she was a bit taken back about my ""backstory"". We talked about it for a bit and after it, I gave her a new outfit that I got her and honestly I have never seen a girl look cuter in a sports bra than her. She pulled it better of than I expected her to and I am really happy, she still tries to impress me every day and feels a need to make me happy.

I didn't annoy her anymore with those questions cause it just makes me so confused more. She can just say ""yes"" I see you as a friend like before, before we meet up personally for the first time. But after we meet personally and have spend time with and had sex a few times (cause we agreed to be just friends with benefits), she started giving me these mixed signals. One time, I got jealous cause people who has crush on her keeps on giving her gifts and I told her about this and said sorry for getting jealous and then she told me not to get jealous cause she doesnt like any of them. She got free movie tickets from those people and said some stuff kind of implying she wants to go on a movie date with me. Thankfully, I am smart enough to guess what she trying to say and I was like ""ohhhh wait so you like to go on a movie date with me?"" but then she just replied ""hahaha"".

I could tell something was up by her short responses toward the end of December. I’ve texted her twice since Dec. 25th both times wishing her a happy Friday and hoping she is doing well. She hasn’t responded so I’m done texting her unless she initiates something.

5586,PCOD and coming out to my gynec,"I've been struggling with PCOD for a while and the condition I have is Menorrhagia.
Doctors in India prescribe date/hormone tablets and i don't think it is good for my health considering the mood swings and other side effects. Also they usually suggest getting married at an early age cos physical relationship has an effect on hormone levels in women. 

It dawned on me that the consultation and mind set of the doctors remain focused/based on heterosexuals. My mother had accompanied me and when the doctor got to know my age (32) her immediate question was why I was still single and that marriage (sex) would help my condition in getting better. 
I asked my mom to step out of the room for a moment and then told my doctor that I was not straight (I realised it was difficult to talk to a stranger about my sexuality). She literally drew a blank face and I blurted out that I'm Asexual.
Her response: you're getting periods you're not asexual.

Facepalm moment; Doctors have no clue on treating lgbtq+ patients in India and aren't even educated on the subject of sexuality. I live in one of the metro cities, Chennai.

5619,How is relationship (romantic/sexual) with age gaps viewed in the wlw community? How prevalent is it?,"First of all, I apologize in advance for my bad English, I'm not a native speaker.

So I just saw a post in /r/dataisbeautiful about Leonardo DiCaprio's dating partners.

I realized that for mlm relationship, it's quite similar, as in, there are lots of young twinks looking for daddies, and daddies looking for young twinks. But I think we differ from the hetero counterpart because I feel the % of mature mlm who are (exclusively? primarily?) into men their age is bigger than % of straight mature men who are into women their age.

But to be fair, my sample size is so limited &amp; wouldn't be a valid one if this were a real research because I just based it from my Grindr experience &amp; gay subreddit users. 

Now, I'm a very inexperienced person, I'm a closeted gay guy, I don't have gay or lesbian friends, and I live in a homophobic society, my exposure &amp; experience about the mlm world are so lacking, more so about the wlw counterpart.

I'm curious about the ""trend"" in wlw relationship, in purely sexual relationships and in romantic ones. Is it similar to the straight counterpart?

And I'm also curious about how relationships with huge age gaps, young-chasers, and old-chasers are viewed in the wlw community.

I hope this is allowed and I hope I don't offend anyone. Thank you so much

Sooooo, basically I have been in love with one of my best friends since we met over 10 years ago. We're both 25 now. I have always been in relationships with guys, but I know I'm not straight. Based on how I've explained my sexuality in the past, I've been told I'm pansexual. I have had a number of sexual partners of all genders and sexualities. One of them being one of my best friends. Who is lesbian. Any time we're both single, we hook up regularly. It started off as just we're both single and want to have sex, so why not? As the years went on, I definitely started to feel a lot more for her and I find my self daydreaming about a relationship with her. Now the not so fun part is that we are both currently in relationships. I've always just kept this feeling pushed waaaay down, and I can not figure out way. There's just something about her, specifically, that makes me so scared to tell her how I really feel. I have had a lot of little moments over the years that make me feel like she might have feelings for me, too. I don't understand why I've never really tried. I don't know why now, after all this time, I suddenly feel like I really need to talk about it, but I do. I guess, I'm just hoping that maybe somebody can help me understand my own feelings.

1. You're so easy to talk to. Everything comes out naturally and I never seem to get nervous. I'm totally myself around you and that's something so refreshing and comforting. I feel like you genuinely listen to me, too, even when I say really stupid stuff. You also text me back and talk to me, too. It never feels one-sided.

2.    No one makes me smile like you do. You're wicked smart and you genuinely make me laugh so much. I always find   
myself looking forward to classes with you. You're just such an interesting person and we relate on so many levels. 

&amp;#x200B;

   3.    This might be super cliché, but you're really, really pretty. You have such profound eyes, and I always notice eyes   
because they're the one thing about a person that never changes. Your smile is absolutely adorable and your laugh   
slays me.

She's leaving from deployment soon and I don't know the next time I'll see her if I ever do again. We've been intimate a few times before, we've been close for almost a year now and spent as much time as we can despite her crazy work schedule. Apparently the navy pushes people to work 7 days a week. We don't spend as much time together as we once did because of this. I'm always really cautious about being consensual because I've been on the other of that, and not on a good side. I'm just iffy about snuggly up to her because of this. We were somewhat sexual, at least close before she passed out but I know it wasnt a good to discuss or push anything like that. I kissed her hand telling as something minor in my head and didn't expect action back, but she kissed my hand too.
We didn't kiss tonight. I wanted to be respectful because I hadn't seen her in a couple months since her last deployment. We just caught up on everything we'd missed for a while. I'm the only person she's seeing. She was tired early. But I want to cuddle one last time. Is that wrong? Is it a bad thing to act on? I'm one of the only people she's ever been with.

5664,How would you react? Is this weird?,"TL;DR: went on one date, she ended up being unavailable. Is it weird to ask her to a sporting event, not as a date?

Met this girl on a dating app. Went on one date that I thought went pretty great, super cool chick, had a lot in common, including our love of sports. She subsequently ended up being on and off flaky via text, canceled on a second date, and then eventually shared she was in a complicated situation with another person and it wasn’t a good time to date. 

I told her I appreciated the honesty, thought she was cool, but I’d let her figure out her situation and leave her alone. 

That was a couple months ago. I now find myself with an extra ticket to a sporting event I think she would really enjoy. Is it weird to contact her and see if she’d be interested in going? She’s legitimately someone I would want to be friends with if she wasn’t interested in dating just bc of our common interests. 

I thought maybe I’d make that clear in the text message... say something like “I get that you’re not looking to date so I hope it’s not interpreted that way. Just thought you might be interested and figured you’d be good company. “

5673,Is she interested or am I misreading this? Should I back off or try harder? Inexperienced lesbian needs advice.,"About 3 months ago I was granted a location transfer at work.  My new work place site is very gay friendly, with most of us being LGBT+.  Around two weeks in, one of the women who works in a cooperating department went out of her way to start greeting me and make small talk every time she seen me.  I reciprocated and didn't give it much thought otherwise.  Just assumed she was being friendly since I was new.  Then a week or so later, I started to notice she was staring at me across the room if she thought I wasn't looking or caught her a few times mid glance (which I'd smile or otherwise acknowledge in a friendly way, first she'd look away like she had been caught then after a few times started smiling back).  Then I noticed small changes in her behavior.  She seemed to be getting nervous, shy, and tongue tied around me, would stand closer when we briefly spoke, go out of her way to be in the same space.  Me, being oblivious as hell, took about another two or three weeks before one day it dawned on me she might be interested.  

This realization came only after I noticed her withdrawing a bit from me suddenly.  I had no idea why she was acting different out of the blue. I've never had a woman show interest in me before, never dated, had a girlfriend, so it never even occurred that she may have been testing the waters to see if I was interested.  I'm still not entirely sure that is the case or am looking too much into it.

Initially I thought maybe I had accidentally offended her or was annoying her by continuing our brief exchanges that may have just been meant to help me settle in at first, so I backed off. To which she stopped initiating any interactions, so I assumed I was right in my guess.  Then one day, I walked into our common area, not really paying attention to anything but getting my coffee, only to hear her start flirting with an out co-worker, who gladly flirted back with great zeal.  I looked up, kind of shocked by the open banter between women, only to see her looking at me, like she was gauging my response.  Then I had to leave to go back to my work area, so I don't know how it proceeded from there.

Last week I wasn't feeling great and groggy from the cold medicine I had taken, by sheer force of habit, I greeted her and said something or other about it being Monday.  She looked utterly confused, like she was having a WTF moment.  Through the fog, I realized what I had did and thought I had annoyed her by talking again, but she awkwardly returned the greeting and walked off.  Now, we're back to our usual routine like nothing happened, she happily greets me and we exchange a few words when we happen to see one another.

I'm not sure what to do or do nothing at all.  Being completely inexperienced, I don't know whether I'm just managing to overanalyze polite behavior or there is something there.  I've literally never flirted with a woman, am socially awkward, and an introvert so I don't even know where to start even if she is interested.  She seems shy and unsure around me herself, which I don't see in her interactions with others.  So, I just don't know.  I just don't want to be wrong about this.  Making a woman uncomfortable, by misinterpreting her actions is a huge source of anxiety for me.  I'm going to assume that she is some shade of gay and single, but I don't know that either for sure.  Just judging her interactions with me and other co-worker from a couple weeks ago, I think she is.

I'm hoping people with more experience can help guide me a bit here.  What should I say?  What should I do?  Anything or leave it be?  I'm terrible at small talk or initiating conversation about anything not related to work.  I tend to draw a blank when it comes to keeping up conversation.  Concrete examples or ideas would be super helpful.

In case anyone asks, she is around my same age, maybe 2-3 years younger at the most.  She isn't a supervisor, team lead, or anything like that.  We're both low-level hourly employees in our respective departments.  There are no dating restrictions between level 1 employees, and for better or worst we really don't see each other much most days.  This isn't a permanent job for me either, so say something did actually manage to pan out and she was interested, it wouldn't be a burden to find employment here elsewhere if need be in the future.",actuallesbians,1578463713,lzbndct,,1,True,2020-01-08

5688,Is my sexuality changing or has it always been this way?,"F 28 yrs old -

 I've had a good amount of boyfriend's, good/ bad relationships and maybe what I call ""curious moments"" with 2 women. There was nothing more than maybe making out with the 2 women. When I was younger I always thought that the woman's body was beautiful. I would draw pictures of naked women (I had a passion for art) and I always caught myself looking at women as they passed me by and gazed at their bodies. Even when I was an exotic dancer for a few years I just couldn't help myself looking at some of the girls as they undressed next to me. I tried not to be obvious of course lol. Now, I've technically always identified as being straight but have had conversations with others about me being bisexual. Despite that I had internally convinced myself I wasn't bisexual. 
  Within the last few months something in me switched? Occasionally I would watch porn and which was usually straight porn. Sometimes it was lesbian but not very often. Now lately I just get so wrapped into just watching women/lesbian porn. I've tried to watch straight porn and I find myself fantasizing just about the woman that I'm watching? 
Another thing that I've noticed changed is..I'm no longer interested in interaction with men anymore? I don't try to flirt, don't like conversation, don't feel connected during sex. It's the strangest thing?  I'm not sure how else to explain it? Is my sexuality changing? Have I been in denial?",actuallesbians,1578479438,redheadedcurse,,1,True,2020-01-08

5705,Is my boss [36F] into me [24F]? What do I do?,"I suppose it'll be difficult, but please don't judge her or me. I'm completely fine with that fact that she's my boss and, while I get people who don't want to shit where they eat, I have no intention of holding this position much longer. 

My boss is a 36-year-old woman who's married to a man. I highly suspect she's in an open marriage. 
She's a naturally flirty type and smiles and winks at almost everybody.. I've also noticed she sometimes lightly touches peoples' arm or knee when talking to them. 


A year and a half ago she started heavily flirting with me, things I find it hard to believe she does with her other employees.. Things like 


- twirling my hair at meetings
- fixing my shirt collar
- at one point she straightened my shirt (although it was fine as it was) and almost touched my crotch while doing so
- almost put a poker chip down my shirt. She was gonna do it but stopped herself. I asked her ""were you gonna put it down my shirt?"", she was embarrassed and replied ""yeah, as a joke""
- once she locked eyes with me for a couple of seconds, smiling, which was pretty intense. I eventually looked away
- told me how pretty I was that day
- some people at my office were (god knows why) talking about sexual harassment and she completely out of the blue said something to the effect of ""women can sexually harass other women too"", and proceeded to look at me and smile (I was in no way part of the conversation and was at a different part of the room) 

I'm pretty sure there's more but I honestly just forgot about other stuff. At the time I didn't know what to make of it. It's obviously flirting but I didn't know why she was doing it, what she was trying to achieve if anything.

She eventually stopped this behavior, as she was pretty angry with me due to things work-related (not my fault really but let's leave it at that). 

She has recently started acting this way again. 
Yesterday at a one on one meeting she told me, out of context, that her husband said how special it was that they, her words: ""still,"" (pause) I asked her ""what?"" and she proceeded to say ""love each other and (pause) are attracted to each other"". Which I suppose she meant to say they still have sex.
During the same meeting she said jokingly that I was hot.

My question/problem is I'm really attracted to her and have no idea how to go about it. She thinks I'm straight (I'm really bi-curious).
**If** she's interested, and that's a pretty big if, I don't want to miss out on this opportunity. I don't want to pursue anything romantic but I guess I would be really glad to kiss her. 

Thank you so much in advance!

I don't care if you don't have boobs (their chest has been something that bothered them forever because of attention from men) but I like the female body. I'm a lesbian.""

They keep saying ""well it's still me, and you love me!"" And i do, or i did. I love them with all my heart and would give the world. But I am a lesbian. The thought of having a husband makes me extremely uncomfortable. My partner is mad and doesn't understand my reasoning.

5723,Missing someone I shouldn't,"Around this time last year, I told a friend of mine I had feelings for her. She kissed me but then completely freaked out, avoided me for months and I was hurt, esp because she was the first and, for now, the only person I've ever had feelings for. Then, around the beginning of April, we were at the same party and she randomly starts talking to me. One thing leads to another and she's kissing me, telling me how she's so sorry, she regrets what she did and the way she handled it, and that she's wanted to do this for a while now etc, all that sweet talk. I was a bit hesitant at first but then we start seeing each other, nothing too serious though because we both know she's leaving the country in a couple months.

Anyway, those few months seem to be going okay like we're just enjoying our time together and I'm really happy, but around mid-June, when it's getting nearer to her having to leave she's becoming more distant and canceling plans and whatnot. After about a week of ignoring me, I told her I didn't mind as long as I got to see her one last time to say goodbye. She continued to ignore that message and just never responded to anything again. I tried planning something again but my text never delivered so I think she blocked me? By the end of July, she left and never gave me a second glance. I'm not exactly sure what happened but I was really hurt. I by no means thought she owed me anything but I feel like I got played. I just felt like I got absolutely no closure and it sucked.

It's a new year now and I thought I was over her but my mind keeps wandering back to her. I think waking up from a dream about her coming back made me miss her all of a sudden. I can't talk to my friends about it because they'll call me silly for thinking about this for a long time so I just needed someplace to vent. But honestly though, I do feel silly abt how long it's taking me. I didn't unfollow her on ig until the end of December and that didn't do me any favours but still idk. I'm positive I'll never see her again but I know there's a small part of me that wants to hear her say the same things she said to me the first time. I know I shouldn't miss her but I do. I want to move on from her completely and just get her out of my head.",actuallesbians,1578505798,fairlyglass,,1,True,2020-01-08

The more I got to know her, the good and the bad, the stronger the feeling got.

 The big-ass catch to all this for me is she lives far away, and distance is a no. And it's exclusively the distance, she explicitly said we'd have been dating a long time ago if she could do distance. 

And then of course she's like my best friend but we haven't even physically met which is like a whole other clusterfuck in my brain l o l

And like now, over a year after we became friends, that gut feeling isn't going away. I'm doing everything I'm supposed to do, focus on me and my life, got back to school and am doing really well, I actually have ideas about what I want from the future again, I'm growing into the person I want to be. And I'm dating an amazing girl which has been really great. And of course tooooonnnsss of therapy lmao. Buttttttt that feeling hasn't gone away.

Great! Fantastic! Its been a while!

Ive been giving dating apps a go for a while with varying success.
Been out IRL, and have recently even given reddit a try on a alt account.

My issue is this, When do I tell them im Transexual?

The issue I seem to have is this, i will connect to someone well, we have the same interests, they compliment my looks ect ect.
I get to the point where I feel safe revealing the fact im transexual, I am coming up to 5 years post op, around 10+ years transitioning.

I dont feel its a big thing, but i prefer honesty above anything else, and this is always said before anything is done, plus sometimes it helps to filter out some people.

Issue is, nearly every person ive revealed it to has instantly switched there behaviour, and safe to say my dating has not been going well.

5751,MUM FOUND MY DILDO,"This is not a false post pleading for upvotes and sympathetic comments... I wish it was.

So me (18) and my girlfriend (18) have been dating for a while now and for her birthday a few months ago, I thought it would be funny but also hot to get her something kind of sexual. I opted for a dildo and strap on underwear (a harness for younger, more intimidated lesbians) which came to about £50 so all in all, I was thrilled. The dildo arrived and I have to say, I am satisfied with my purchase; it became more of a present for me than for her. Sorry for boring you with the context but a post like this can't be abrupt. 

The story brings us to today and despite it being exam season, I was in high spirits due to my clothes order from Pull &amp; Bear arriving. As you do, I tried on my order in the living room with my mum and we began to have a chat about our day and such. The topic of conversation was then brought to a situation a few days ago where my mum explained she was looking for a DVD with my brother (20) who was home from uni. Immediately, I knew what was going on. She gets to the point (if you pardon the pun) and states that in looking for the DVD she found the box that the dildo came in (again, pardon the pun). Now, bit more context, my mum is very liberal and always has been, an example being her letting me drink and smoke weed for a few years now and we also have a close, healthy relationship (probably the best scenerio I can be in given the cripplingly awkward situation). I thought to myself in the moment 'oh, not too embarrassing, she's only found the brown box that it arrived in'. Then it dawned on me that said box boasted aggressively the words '7 INCH SILCONE CURVED DILDO' paired with the phrase 'perfect for hitting that *spot'.* Mortified. I understand that this could be so much worse and that I should in fact be very grateful that my mum is so accepting, she even laughed and went on to say that she is 'proud' of me for such a 'bold move' and that she's happy she's brought up such a sexually confident daughter. I just can't help cringing yet my girlfriend thinks it's hilarious and that she loves me even more.

I hope that this story has cheered up any bad days and that you've laughed at my misfortune. I promise to keep you updated if the plot thickens. To conclude, I think there should definatley be a word added to the English language to describe, specifically, the feeling a teenager gets when their mum finds something embarrassing because it truly is an emotion like no other.

5760,She always wants sex,"My girlfriend wants to have sex with me 24/7 pretty much, even in public or when there are other people around (like our friends for a sleepover or she tried touching my boobs when my little nephew was hanging out with us). Recently I've gotten mono, so I've been really tired lately and haven't had as much of a sex drive. 

When we hang out all I want to do is literally just hang out with her, be in her company, cuddle, watch netflix, play xbox, eat snacks, etc. But she always turns everything we do into an opportunity for sex. I've told her several times that I'm too tired to have sex or I'll move her hand if she tries touching my boobs or thigh or something, but then she just gets upset with me and accuses me of not being into the relationship as much as we used to be. 

It's gotten to the point where fucking her seems more like a chore than anything. And making her cum no longer brings me sexual satisfaction, but relief that I can stop. However she always seems to be horny until she has had like her 5th orgasm.  But sometimes if she has only orgasmed once I'll stop because I'm too tired or just not in the mood, and then she'd start grinding on me to try to get herself off, causing me to either finish her off quicker with my hands or just let it happen. And it's also gotten to the point where I just let her fuck me when she feels like it because telling her to stop only seems to make her upset. I've started faking orgasms just so I could try to relax with her but she never seems to stop at just one ""orgasm"". 

I've voiced to her before that I feel like she wants sex more than anything, and she just gets upset with me. I do admit I was a ""sex maniac"" like a few months ago when we started seeing eachother, but it's just gotten old and I have no sex drive because of my mono. I just wish she would understand. I just wish she wouldnt get upset with me for not wanting to fuck for once.",actuallesbians,1578522181,Sn4ilM4il,,1,True,2020-01-08

5763,"I am heartbroken, I think. I don't know what to do with myself anymore.","Hey everyone, much love to you all. 

I am feeling pretty lost and fragile at the moment, I would really appreciate if anyone here could help me, because I'm finding it hard to help myself. I'm sorry if this is long, it is the last place left and I feel that some outside perspective would do me good.

It starts with a girl, cliche I know, I'll call her Ay. I've known her for three and a half months but it feels like we've known each other for much longer. There is something that just works and I have no idea what it is, it confuses me so much but I always go back. We were interested in each other but then I was an idiot and pushed her away because of fear of commitment, neither of us have ever been in a relationship before. She then started something with a girl, I'll call her Bea, at her accommodation. We're at university together so this resulted and at first I didn't mind because I wasn't in love with her. 

Whilst this was going on Ay and I would face time (ft) each other for hours and hours, our first ft lasted five hours and I remember it so well, she was so quiet and I was just chatting away. As the term went by, we continued to talk. We would stay up so late but I didn't care because we always had so much to talk about. I have never felt so comfortable with anyone in my life. We study art together and our work started to solidify itself into our relationship, she would record the FaceTime's for her art and I would draw whilst we were talking. My artwork is my life and now we had embedded each other into our creative projects. I would help her with her work and I would love to listen to all her ideas, she would do the same for me. It just worked. We would talk about other things too, deep or stupid it didn't matter. It is a relationship that I've never experienced ever.

Ay and Bea continued to be together and at one point near the middle of the term they started to going out. When we were in the studios Ay would want to touch me and be close to me and we would still talk often. She was open about how she felt and that she didn't know what she wanted to do or who she wanted to be with. Ay was also honest and there were moments when she was also unsure. Another mistake I made was that I didn't have the self-respect to realise that I shouldn't be waiting around for anyone or anything, but I didn't care. We would always come back to each other. I wanted to support her through everything, and didn't want to force her into anything either. I only wanted to have her in my life. I also started to feel horrifically guilty, I've never even met Bea but I didn't want to hurt her.

Christmas holidays, we decided to take this as an opportunity to have some distance and think about what we wanted. But then we would start talking, all day, everyday, for a week. Took a quick break (a day) and then did the same for another week. Always face timing and we didn't even need to be talking, just being there with the other was good enough. Ay met up with Bea and posted about it on instagram, this is when I first realised that seeing them together hurt me. I had to accept my feelings for her. Ay and Bea broke things off as Bea wanted to take a break. I still didn't know everything that was going on with them, I know that Ay didn't want to tell me everything. After this we tried to take some time apart several times, I needed space and I knew that she needed it too. Then she would message me, I'd reply and then we would start talking again. Every single time.

Ay told me that she loved me and soon after I told her that same, but we also acknowledged that neither of us really understood what love is. I met up with Ay and we ended up sleeping together, I won't give details, but that was another mistake. I was determined to not meet up with her during the holidays and it happened anyway. A couple of days later I got a message from her that she needed to talk about us. We called and she basically told me that she was indecisive about me and Bea because Bea offers her the physical part of a relationship and I offer her an emotional one. She also mentioned that when we first me she didn't notice me at all, that is one of the things that hurt most. I am also going to mention that I find physical intimacy extremely difficult, I am trying to work on myself but it's hard. I've had so many bad experiences, at the beginning of term I was too drunk and alone, went home with a guy and don't remember much. I woke feeling the worst I've ever felt and it scares me still.

I just cannot continue with this anymore, I hate who I am in this situation. Sad and weak. I love her and I know that she still wants to be friends with me, but who's to say that something else won't happen? I feel self-destructive and I want to completely rip myself away from her. I can only describe it as emotional self-harm. I want to speak with her but if I do that I don't think that I'll stop loving her. I want to suffer and feel pain, I want to make myself lose someone that I care so much about.

5767,Internalized homophobia? 24F wlw,"Hiii. 

So
A little background story...

I only just came out a few months ago. I’ve been dating this girl for 2 months now and she’s the first woman I’ve ever been with. 

I always identified as bi (secretly) but discovered that I was actually just gay when I realized why I didn’t want to marry my ex boyfriend. 

Moving on-

I absolutely love being with the girl I am dating. She is beautiful and sexy and makes me laugh and smells amazing lol I’ve never been so happy or intoxicated by another human being before. Obviously, she turns me on. A lot. Lol. 

But sometimes I catch my brain thinking “this is wrong” or something when we’re together. Like, we’ll be making out and I’ll be like “omg she’s pretty and boobs and ahhhh” and then a second later my brain goes “this is not right”. And then I get annoyed that that thought even passed through my mind and it makes me want to kiss her even more. 

Has anyone else experienced this? I guess it’s internalized homophobia? I’ve never ever been against queer people, especially because I am one of them, so why would I be? It’s like my brain is secretly plotting against me. Or maybe just because that’s all we really see in the media so maybe I’m now just wired to think that way after being in the closet for so long?

To Judy (not aunt Judy, you're fine.) : Not every lesbian wants to date you. Actually, I don't think anybody would really like to date you. Also, LGBT+ people deserve friends and an education, but shitty fake friends like you don't.

to my teacher last school year: You know you ruined my life, right? You can't expel people just because they are part of the LGBT+ community. They actually have to do something wrong. Also, just because somebody says something does not mean it is true. You taught us about proof and claims or whatever last year, but clearly you couldn't understand a single word coming out of your mouth.

5788,Need some help with inappropriate crush.,"... or is it?! Bit of a long, boring story. Basically, she is my dentist. We’ve also become friends too, we text, have so much in common that it’s actually weird. 

we knew each a tiny bit before she became my dentist but didn’t really talk so much; then I had terrible toothache so I called her and she told me to come in. She was of course super professional and fantastic in dealing with my terrible anxiety. It ended up being 4 appointments and after each one I’d text her to thank her and we had some chat but nothing major. I did realize I was developing feelings but would never pursue because of her job. 

Then, my phone accidentally pocket dialed her and I died. She did call me straight back and reassured me it was actually good to talk to me, she was actually on vacation too. Then when we hung up she texted me and said, “it was nice to hear your voice”. I died again. Blah blah, some time passed and we had the odd talk but nothing major and I was over it. Until I had to see her for a check up a few weeks ago and during it she suggested we meet up. Of course I said yes but I had to leave the country for 3 weeks for work. We texted while I was gone and said we’d arrange something when I got home. So! Then it was Christmas and on New Year’s Eve I got a text from her wishing me a good one. We talked all night and the next day, and I said “ok, let’s meet” and she said “yup, better late than never”. 

So, it seems like she wants to see me, but I have no idea if she’s gay, even though everybody I’ve shown photos of her to think she is. I’m so nervous that I’m getting my hopes up for no reason, I’m scared to text and arrange something because I have the worst social anxiety and always feel like I’m being annoying.

The abusive guy my sister is involved with turns out to be homophobic as well","I posted about this on my facebook but I needed to also vent to another group who would really understand how hurtful this is. This is not about my little sister that I've posted about in this group before. I'm copying my facebook post because I don't feel like typing the whole situation again:

 I don't like airing dirty laundry on facebook but I wanted people to know that homophobic, sexist and ableist pieces of crap like this exist. My sister has had a ""friendship"" with this guy she met on the internet awhile back ago that she has developed feelings for and while I was in Maryland he started to use her and manipulate her. Using her car and money and belittling and degrading her, making her feel like he was the only one who cares about her. When I was in Maryland I got screenshots of horrendous crap he said to my sister so I sent him some texts strongly telling him how unacceptable and abusive his behavior was. He never replied. Yesterday he went on another pissy tirade while in possession of my sister's car. I had to drive my sister back and forth to work and then he left her car unlocked with her keys in a parking lot and I had to rush to help my sister find it. I tried to contact him to get info so my mom could take him off the I insurance my sister's car is under (for some reason she let her put him on the policy). Later when my sister was having car problems and I picked her up from the mechanic she was talking to him on the phone like the previous events did not happen. I was understandably upset. I text him letting him know that I would find a way to still take him off the insurance even without his info. Still no response so I left it at that thinking he might have blocked me. Well tonight my sister was screaming in my face saying I had no right to text him about the insurance and that he was gonna file harassment charges. Maybe it wasn't the smartest decision but I texted him and told him that I didn't think he really had much of a case. This is screenshots of what happened. The worst part of it all is my sister saying I deserved all of what he said to me in these texts. I've gone through so much emotional labor supporting my sister each time the cycle of abuse peaks while dealing with my own issues. I'm tired of it. I'm not gonna put up with this. I have blocked him and I have also blocked my sister temporarily.

I don’t want to love her anymore. I really don’t. I always new l liked girls. My female best friend 7th-college was my best kept secret( along with a few others here and there.) People thought we were really close. They were right... more so than they realized. 
Early 20’s l got invited to church and was taught about my sin. My indulgence in my flesh that led me into girls’ arms. I vowed never to be evil again and so self indulgent. I buried that girl and got baptized. I became a spokesman for Christ. I was the girl who left girls for God. What a testimony 
Fast forward l am 21 yrs with a man l met as soon as l joined the church. We were put together as a couple to draw others to God through our testimony of our evil we repented of. 
We have 3 babies (9,13,15) and we have struggled HARD! I don’t love him. i never felt that feeling for him. I mean l care about him. Like he’s a person who l have spent time with. The day we married, we had never even kissed 

Few years in I began drinking just to get naked with him. To kiss him. I used wine to “get out of my head” A problem every stay at home mom whose tired has! Right?
Ummm l stared to notice l had crushes on my kids’ friends Moms at times. Once a girl who briefly came to church (but left due to returning back to being a lesbian), even she knew.  She singled me out of 100’s inviting me to sleep overs and girls nights. I think we often know when we meet each other. Don’t you?
I have slept 5 yrs in separate rooms from him and lived in a sexless marriage. I met HER the one that you can’t deny..., like a year ago. We had a full affair... but he scared her away

I got real about being gay... don’t go to church anymore and have kids that are mad at me. I am alone afraid and hate this life. I sometimes want to wish my self away... or just build someone new. Any way l turn l hurt someone... perhaps lm better off finding the way that hurts others the least, even if it hurts me he most. I want out.",actuallesbians,1578545075,all4my3,,1,True,2020-01-08

So about 2 months ago, I posted about pining for a straight girl on this sub.
A lot of my honeymoon phase had drifted away at this point, but I still had times where my heart skipped a beat. So I decided today to tell her how I was feeling, just so there’s no secrets and that we understand each other.

We were waiting to get picked up from school and I sat down with her (let’s call her Sky). I decided eh let’s make this casual. The conversation went a little something like this:

Me: “Hey Sky?”
Sky: “yeah?”
Me: “I’m just gonna make this clear so we understand each other and stuff; I like you. You’re cute, you’re funny, and you’re really nice. I just wanted to let you know”
Sky: “...I actually knew”
Me: “wait what”
Sky: “I was scrolling through your reddit a little bit after you posted that.”

At this point I was laughing my ass off. I knew my friends knew my reddit, but I never knew they would scroll through it! Especially at that most convenient moment.

Sky: “yeah the group project was a little awkward after that haha”
Me: “Aw I’m sorry haha”
Sky: “A (one of my gay friends who basically said damn that sucks) was asking VERY pointed questions while looking straight at you”
Me: “Damn haha”
A, just getting to where we were sitting: “What’cha talking about”
Me: “I told her”
A: “Told her what?”
Me: “That I like her”
A: “Ohhhh”

We basically continued the conversation after that until Sky had to leave. I also told Sky about some other things I’m dealing with, like the confusion around my sexuality and jazz. 

We don’t feel the same way about each other but that’s okay! I think we are much better as friends than a couple. I’m not ready for that yet, I have my own issues to work out. I am just extremely thankful that I have friends who love and care for me.

Oh and Sky if you are reading this (you know who you are)

5833,So my new gf doesn't like my taste and I don't like hers. Help! (Plus update on my last post) nsfw,"I posted a while back about a new girl I started dating and lemme just start with a quick update.

I haven't said it yet and neither has she, but DAMN I love her! She's so funny, smart but dumb in a relatable way, kind, friendly, a great snuggler, and the Top/switch to my bottom/switch. I could go on for hours about how wonderful she is and how luck y iam to have her, but I have a migraine so my brain is dying atm. We did both have the exclusive talk though and have deleted all dating apps so squeee!!!

Anyways, we had sex for the first time yesterday! It was my first time with a woman and first time having consensual sex, so I was pretty nervous. But it all felt very natural and smooth. I'd been wanting to sleep with her for a while so was excited but still nervous. Anyways she started to go down on me but said I had a rather ""strong"" taste and one she wasnt used to, so just used her fingers which was fine with me. I didn't think I'd finish but I did and it was amazing! We then switched places and I tried going down on her (she didn't know yet it was my first time, I told her after and she was super happy and excited that she took my v card which I  thought was so sweet!) but wasnt able to handle the taste. It wasn't necessarily bad, but it was twhat I was used to and it made me gag. So I just did what she did and used my fingers, and while it took a bit of direction and guidance I shockingly was able to make her orgasm kinda quickly! We were both surprised at how well it all went (she assured me she finished and had a good time). Afterwards we quickly got dressed (we both have body confidence issues) and cuddled for like 2 hours just chatting. We talked about getting dental dams bc we both want to eat each other out, but struggled with it.

I tend to have rather pungent urine and vaginal exrections due to some medical issues I have (idk what exactly causes it yet but I've tried diet changes to no avail and am clean of STD's and drugs). She said I didnt smell weird it was just the taste. I felt the same about her, I think she smelled nice it wa just the flavor that got me.

I think for now using dams is a great idea, but idk how long we could keep that up as they're expensive. Is there something we could do to make the process better for either of us? A way to get used to it, mask it, or change the flavors?

Anyways I'm super super happy both in my relationship and my overall first time experience. Her bday is next week and I'm taking her to the zoo to celebrate (we may be in our early 20's but apparently were actually 8) and I'm planning on saying I love you then (we talked about how we both tend to feel it early but are nervous to say it, so I'll follow the vibes of the day and hopefully tell her I love her!).

Either way I thought I'd done well for my a levels. I was expecting A*A*A but I got horrific grades. I had dreams of going to imperial college or Cambridge or Harvard I'd always thought I was a smart kid, I went to a smart school I studied with smart kids.   

The grades I got were such a slap in the face. I feel ashamed and humiliated and horrified. I can't bear facing my peers or my closest friends to hear the excellent grades they got and the excellent places they're going. 

It feels like my pride has been dashed against a rock. I hate it I hate it I hate it I hate it so so so so much it's so difficult and painful. I can already imagine the looks of shock on my teacher's faces. 

Id always been counting on getting great grades and going great places. So that when I came out or got a gf home,,,my parents would have to think we'll my daughters come from Cambridge I'm proud of her so it's fine.

5838,What experiences of homophobia from complete strangers have you had?,"So really it wasn't until I first displayed  public affection with a girlfriend that I realised how prominent homophobia from absolute strangers was (also its not like I live in some cut off country village, it's a large town with gay clubs etc). 

I wasn't able to hold her hand at the beach without getting a dozen sneers, and then when I first kissed her in a club we were heckled by this terrifying guy who shouted at us and followed us for ages saying how disgusting we were, and when I told a bouncer because we were actually getting scared by this guy, he told us to leave and be more careful next time... Rather than kicking out the harasser... 
Once we were holding hands in a pub at a table by ourselves, one person walked by and said 'god no we're not sitting next to the effing lesbians' and then 5mins later we were approached by someone else who said 'can you stop doing that, you're making me and my wife uncomfortable' referring to us holding hands..... I must admit it was only out of principle that I did not comply, really I wanted to get up and leave as it made me feel so rejected by everyone in the room. 

Since these experiences I've been way more wary about showing any public affection with a girlfriend.

So i wanna tell my friend I like girls. We are neighbours so we spend a lot of time hanging out and I told her I don't trust people that much because people used my loyalty and trust as a friend before. But she seems like nice person ( I said that about all my previous friends) and she told me she is just like me when it comes to trust. Anw, I have told 3 other people I like girls but 2 of them stopped talking to me due to lack of communication and the third one doesn't like it when i talk about girls because when i first was freaking out about the thought I was very negative about it. ( my mom and dad are Muslims and religious people and kinda close minded when it comes to these type of things) so I apologised for annoying her and promised never to talk again girls again. 
But i am a type of person that trusts to easily and  wants to share myself with the friends I trust. honestly I am tierd of pretending and saying as a joke ""Gotta get the D"" or something stupid like that. We are also in the same uni so she asks me a lot who I like or if there is someone and I am tierd of saying that there is someone that might like me.

i never have identified as a woman. im 100% not a woman. i am also 100% not a man, even more so not a man than not a woman. i consider myself agender. i have had top surgery and was on t for a short while but i am way more comfortable being seen as a woman by strangers, than being seen as a man. both bc dysphoric reasons but also bc my connection to womanhood and being seen as a woman and oppression and the like. anyway, i recently realized i fkn hate men and i never wanna date them again, and i was wondering if its ok to call myself a lesbian and having the definition (for me) mean ""not a man who likes not-men"" bc thats how i feel. and if one were to consider societal standards for sexuality i definitely ""pass"" as a lesbian since im AFAB and i only like AFAB folks and thats what lesbian means according to the definitions ive read (but they usually use afab and woman interchangeably).

so, can i be a lesbian - meaning im a not-man and i only dig not-men? cause i dont wanna call myself bi because i throw up at the thought of a man in any context so like. i wanna close the door. but i also dont wanna misgender myself or other folks i might wanna get groovy with. my pronouns are they/them btw!

5858,When a girl flirts with you as a joke and you suddenly know how a dog feels when their owner only pretends to throw the ball...,"Bit of a rant post, I hope that's allowed.

The story basically: we have me, some kind of not-straight (still not totally clear on exact label) and not out to anyone. And we have her, a friend of a friend who became part of our group. And she would be kind of flirty with me - at first it was kind of slightly flirty/dirty jokes where it wasn't clear if it was actual flirting. Not wanting to assume too much I just kind of laughed along. But then it was 'hey look at my tongue piercing', and our other friends making jokes about the two of us being girlfriends, and other stuff that came across as not super straight, y'know, and I started to think maybe it was genuine, maybe I should talk to her about it. I wasn't sure if I had an actual crush on her, but I was starting to think about it...

...and then she starts dating a guy we know (who is lovely and they make a nice couple). So I'm like welp cool lemme just bottle all this right back up and never speak of it again. But the real kicker is, a few days ago when we're all hanging out together she starts talking about a girl at her work who had a crush on her, and everyone acts like it's so funny, and I'm sitting there like 'there but for the grace of social anxiety go I'",actuallesbians,1578582033,ConsciousCheesecake6,,1,True,2020-01-09

5862,"If you were me, would you make a move? (Going to travel with my crush and my friend)"," Hey!

I'm REALLY excited because of that:

I started uni last september and there's my friend (a straight girl on a online relationship) and there's my other girl (this really cute girl).

This girl is a little nerdy (in a good way) and I always make her laugh, we have fun together, she wants to do school projects with me and she knows I'm gay and she just asked if dating girls wasn't harder than boys (I told her that I didn't know 'cause I haven't dated a girl yet). But... she liked a boy (an old friend of her) since we started the course. Then, yesterday I saw her after all x-mas hollydays and I asked her about how was it going with the boy and she told me like: Meh, I haven't seen him that much. And I started to read my notes before the exam and I could see her looking at me the entire time.

I don't know if it's just me but OMG.

So, going back to my question: my straight friend told me to go with her on a travel to meet her boyfriend but I told her no because she would be with the boy and I would be all the trip alone. This was okay until... she told me that she asked this cute girl and she told her that she would go only if I go!

I MEAN, GIRLS THAT'S AWESOME

I'll probably say yes to the trip if my parents agree on that.

But, do you think I should try to make a move? Imagine that she says no and we are alone on a travel, that would be really weird but, on the other side, it's an unique oportunity.

5871,Asking girl I’m dating if she’d be ok w an open relationship—bad or terrible idea?,"So I met a girl on Tinder in November, and we’ve been talking ever since and have also gone out ~4 times. She graduated from our university in December and moved back with her parents about an hour away, so we mostly text these days. We’re not exactly girlfriends at this point but have both expressed interest in seeing where things go.

The thing is, I have a WAY higher sex drive than she does. When I brought up the subject, she said she wasn’t quite ready for sex with a woman yet (didn’t really go into detail), and I totally respect that and in no way want to push her. But I’m also newly out (within the last six months) and really want some sexual experience (am a virgin with both men and women). I feel like she and I might have a better experience when she’s ready if I have some idea of what to do. 

So what I’ve thought is, what if I seek out something purely casual and physical in the meantime, while continuing to develop our relationship? She’s said she’s okay with polyamory/open relationships, though I’m not sure if she meant personally or in general. Even though we’re not exactly committed, I would definitely ask her first, just because I believe in total transparency.

5878,Am I bisexual or just horny?,"My question looks harmless.

I just ruined 7 years of perfect relationship after meeting the son of my wife.

I am 25,she is 40. She gave birth with 16, her husband died later.

I spent a year going through mental rehab. I am shameless, perverted and openminded. I went into rehab because of stress and child abuse I went through. 

Let me clear one thing before I start. I love porn, I love sex, I have the most craziest fetish es and fantasies and still can't believe that my wife loves me despite knowing all of them. I told her that I love incest, blood, piss, pain, cheating and sweat. I get wet when I see my wife going nude outside in out garden and freezing or feeling coldness myself. We have a mirror above our bed so I can see us having sex to get more aroused. We also bouth us multiple mouses because I get horny when things crawl on my skin. 

Anywayyyyys. 

Her son is in the military and the German military pays good and so he was able to rent an small flat for him while he has a large apartment that was rented by a family and he gets extra money every month. He is 24. He is engaged. He is a womanizer. His current fiancée is his sixth fiancée in two years. He was married three times since his 18 birthday and has a son from his first time. I didn't meet my wifes son till a month ago but, even though I identify as a leabian (I am unsure at the moment), I had to admit that this man was hot.

What I found out in in one month about him were a bit shocking.

He is a pervert and gets bored with playing with dull girls. We went out to eat in an restaurant the first day I met him. We all sat down together and my wife asked how Janine was (his first wife). He bluntly said that they divorced 6 months afterwards because she wasn't as crazy in bed as he was.

He is an asshole, fucking woman left and right and then dropping them. I was disgusted by him.

A week later he dropped his son of because my wife and his son wanted to spend time together.

Well they left and i showed him what was broken in our room so he could repair it. 

It didn't even took him an hour so get me into bed.

It happened two weeks ago and I still couldn't believe it. I was never straight. Never thinking of boys and then he pops up and managed to give me on of the best adventures I ever had.

I pleaded on my knees that he doesn't tell it his mother. I had to suck him off so he would shut up and then litteraly told me six minutes later that he loves me for keeping his mom happy.

I had sex with my wife in the past two weeks but it wasn't like always. It felt dull, as if something was missing.

I want it again, but I also want to stay with my wife. What should I do?

i have two long term friends that i'm honestly questioning if they're toxic, they don't emotionally support me at all and they lowkey make me feel kind of... lonely. and i don't feel comfortable yet coming out to them; one of them is in a friend group with racist, homophobic transphobic people and it kinda makes me think, if that's the type of people she befriends does that say something about her? and my other friend is just not emotionally supportive at all, it feels like i'm talking to a wall sometimes. and she judges me sometimes with little things but it adds up and makes me feel like shit. i want to talk to both of them but we're kinda young so i don't know if they'll understand or care? and i hope that they can outgrow this and change but tbh i don't really have hope, i'm tired of waiting for them to improve yknow? and i'm too scared to talk to them about all of this because i might just be overreacting and they'll be hurt. ugh.

and i've started sitting with one of the only groups of alt people at my school. they're a small group of theater kids (i'm not in theater tho) and they seem pretty chill and accepting, but i'm really only acquaintances with them. i'm only friends with one of the people in the group, who's a trans girl. i want to talk to her about me questioning my gender identity but we're not really that close because i only became friends with her a few months ago, and i've only talked to her at lunch and in my classes where we've joked around. i don't want to dump my problems on her yknow? and honestly, with all my friends i'm kind of the ""funny friend"". i have no idea how to have serious conversations about emotions with anyone because everyone views me as the humorous one and nothing more serious than that. i feel like they don't realize or care that i have my own problems. i was diagnosed with social anxiety recently, so obviously i've had trouble making friends and that's probably contributing to why i feel this way.

5894,Confusing times!,"I am 27 and currently in a relationship with a man. I have only ever dated boys growing up and As a teenager I called myself straight I just assumed that’s what I was because it seemed normal and I liked boys and so did all my friends.
When I hit high-school  I noticed I had sort of an attraction to woman. I’d prefer  lesbian porn to straight porn. I’ve had crushes on woman but I’d be too nervous  to approach them. Maybe they wouldn’t feel the same way. They were probably straight. I felt embarrassed and ashamed for feeling the way I did. My school didn’t have much of a gay community. 
Once i hit college I accepted my attraction to woman and thought of myself as bisexual but  I’ve still only been in relationships and had sex with men because men have pursued me and woman haven’t. I’m also a lot more intimidated by woman. Maybe that’s the attraction? 
And to me that didn’t matter, I was happy only being with Men. Didn’t feel like I was really missing out. 

However over the last year or so this attraction to woman has grown a lot stronger. I find myself fantasying about woman  so much more often including while I’m having sex with my boyfriend. It’s hard to have an orgasm without thinking about being with woman. 
That makes me feel guilty because I feel like I’m not being honest with him. I’m still very attracted to my boyfriend and we have a wonderful relationship he does know about my attraction to woman but I don’t think he realizes to what extent. Now I don’t just think about them sexually I think about love and relationships. 
And  I fear this feeling isn’t going anywhere anytime soon and I’m really not sure what to do about it. 
I always thought people had their sexuality figured out by the time they hit puberty. Why am I having such confusing thoughts at this point in my life? 
I really feel like I want to explore this side of myself but I feel like people won’t understand. I don’t even really understand it myself.

5897,Help! I’m always sooo timid about initiating sex :(,"I dated cis men for most of my life, but a few years ago for whatever reason I stopped being emotionally attracted to men completely and since then have only dated women. This has been wonderful for the most part, but when it comes to having sex with people with vaginas I’m so timid! I guess cis men tend to be socialized to be the initiators of sex, so in the past I was never worried about whether or not my partner wanted to have sex. They almost always did, and they almost always initiated, and I would basically decide if I was in the mood or not. Sex was very consistent. 

But with women I feel so confused and timid about sex! When I’m with dominant women it’s no problem, we have plenty of sex. But most of my partners haven’t been very dominant at all, so I end up having way less sex because I’m just not used to having to be in a role of starting things up! So it always just feels like each of us is waiting for the other person to initiate sex. And I get really in my head about whether or not my partner even *wants* to have sex at any given moment, so I’m scared to make a move and be rejected, or I’m nervous I’m not good enough at sex, or I’m scared I won’t be able to keep going for as long as it takes without getting tired, etc. etc. And this is true no matter how long I’ve been dating that partner. It’s just really scary for me!

So, I have a new partner now, and we’ve had sex a few times, but it’s mostly been when we’ve had a few drinks together and I stop being so in my head about making that move towards it. But I don’t want to rely on substances to have sex with my girlfriend! I want to work through this. 

Please, does anyone have any ideas or tips for how I can get out of my head about this and learn how to be more comfortable initiating intimacy, and more sexually confident?

5902,I have the biggest crush on my best friend and don't know how to tell her.,"So, I am an out and proud Bisexual 19 year old. I have known my best friend, who we'll call M, since elementary school.

Me and M are literally the closest you can get to a best friend. We have known each other since we were 8. We have been through everything together. She was there for me through every big moment in my life. 

It was in high school, sophomore year, when I knew I had a crush on her. We were having a sleepover and I was super nervous because I was about to go on my first date ever and she was helping me prep. At the time I knew I was probably not straight but I didn't tell anyone yet. 

So basically, I was panicking, because I have never kissed anyone before, and I didn't know what to do if he tried to kiss me. And as I was ranting, she grabbed my chin, and kissed me. And it was the best thing I have ever experienced. I remember my face burning and my stomach having the literal most butterflies.

When she pulled away I feel like I noticed her in a different way. I have always, always thought M was beautiful. Not just her looks, but everything about her. But this time, it was different in a way I can't explain. 

I remember how her hand was still holding my chin and how her mossy green eyes looked into my brown ones. And we stayed like that for what felt like forever. When she pulled away she just said There you go, that's how you do it, and went to bed.

Ever since then I couldn't help but fall hopelessly in love with her.

And now I don't know what to do, I want to tell her. She is also Bisexual, and I have seen her date both guys and girls, but she has never really shown interest in me like that. She tells me that I'm beautiful, and any person would be lucky to have me, but it feels like she's saying it in a best friend sort of way.

So I don't know what to do and I need advice, so, basically, help!",actuallesbians,1578605776,Ella_Summers,,1,True,2020-01-09

5905,"Need to get over my crush, I'm falling into a depression","Hi,

I don't want to make this too long, but here it goes:

I've liked this girl for a long time and recently she has confessed she likes me too. Sadly, due to reasons like her not being out of the closet and long distance, there will not be anything happening on that front for a loooong time if ever at all.

So, I've been a fool and let myself feel and be happy and all that for a bit instead of repressing. However as of lately, I've been developing some major insecurities. Due to the fact that she has never been very open about her feelings towards me and me doubting my own qualities so to say. I for example asked if she thought I was pretty, but ""she think I am atleast cute"" and yeahh stuff like that.
I am developing some body issues, thinking I'm ugly and not desirable, scared of meeting up because I might really suck in person, etc. Maybe irrational, but happening nonetheless.
I can feel myself slipping back into a depression. Had a depression a few years ago with some of the same insecurities amongst other things, but from a different ""reason"". Since I've experienced it before, I can just feel myselr slip back to it.

I've tried to talk to her about this and I genuinely told her that I've had some insecurities which I added that none of it is her fault, but it developed after the whole ""liking eachother, but relationship is now impossible thing"". She told me that things would smooth out eventually and then changed the subject. I was afraid I would feel worse after talking and indeed that happened.

So please, I'm rather desperate, could you guys give some solid tips on how to get over someone? I am willing to try out anything. Please be as honest as you can.

5908,This has been bothering me,"I've seen people say stuff like ""being LGBT ruins your relationship with your family"" and ""being LGBT shows you that your parents' love is completely conditional"" and that's not true-- that's not a universal experience. The family's bigotry ruins the relationship. It's not the gay kid's fault that their parents suck. It's not YOUR fault that your parents have unrealistic, unattainable preconceptions of who you're gonna be. And it's not YOUR fault if they freak out when they find out that you're not the person they expected you to be. You know? Being LGBT doesn't ruin shit-- it's never YOUR fault as a gay person that the people around you reject you. 

My sister and I are both LGBT and we were not rejected in any way by our family. My great uncle was gay, and when he told his brother, my grandpa, (who was raised to be super homophobic), my grandpa pretty much instantly changed his tune about gay people. My grandparents make the effort to use my friends' they/them pronouns. My mom is willing to learn about complex gender identity. I've known queer people whose families have rejected them, and queer people whose families are totally accepting and loving. The only constant is that it's the FAMILY's job to learn. Its THEIR job to nurture or destroy the relationship. The agency to hurt or love a gay kid is on THEM. It's NEVER your fault when your family rejects you, it's NOT because you're LGBT, it's NOT because you came out, it's NOT because of who you are or who you love-- it's on the homophobes. They're the ones who ruin shit. They're the ones.

It bothers me to see this rhetoric, to see people being like ""this is because I'm gay, this is because of me."" No! No. Just no. It's them. They're the ones with the problem, it's their flaw, their sin, their choice, their sickness. It's never, ever your fault. 

You deserve better people. There are better people-- better relationships, better love, better families out there for you. If you feel like your relationships with your family were ruined because you're LGBT, know that those people failed YOU. You didn't fail them. They were the ones that fucked everything up. You owe them nothing, you owe no guilt, you owe no shame. It's all on them.",actuallesbians,1578610961,Unfey,,1,True,2020-01-09

5919,Am I doomed to be alone forever?,"This is going to be a long post, so sorry in advance. It’s a topic that is taking a toll on me so I guess writing it out is also cathartic in a way. 

So I’m almost 20 and am in college. I’ve never even kissed anyone (I know, so lame). I’ve known that I have been gay my entire life. When I was young I was a little Tom boy and super carefree, as I got older I guess because of the homophobic environment I grew up in I wanted to appear as straight as possible to compensate so that nobody would ever even think that I was gay. 

Currently I’m extremely girly, but I’ve grown into it and honestly feel more comfortable like this as though I’ve solidified my identity, so I don’t feel comfortable changing my appearance to present more “stereotypically gay”. Although I feel like more girls who I might not know are lgbt would possibly approach me. Everyone assumes that I’m straight and even some people that I’ve told still don’t believe me after telling them multiple times (it’s kind of frustrating). 

I see people my age who have long been in multiple relationships and I’ve never even kissed anyone (the reason I’ve never kissed any guys is because I’ve always known I was gay and really don’t have any interest in trying that out, also don’t want to lead them on). 

Another big problem is that the type of girls I like are also the very “straight looking” type. I’m in a sorority and honestly I’ve had so many secret crushes on girls in other sororities but They all turned out to be straight. I don’t think I would ever feel comfortable coming out to all my sisters because Greek life has such a heteronormative culture. I’ve also never met a single lesbian or bisexual girl that I’ve been attracted to (where are you guys finding all these girls??) Basically everyone I know is straight. 

At this point I just really want to date someone to experience something, and honestly sometimes I’m terrified I’m going to die alone (oh god is this sounding incel-y?? Lol.) my friends are constantly hooking up with guys and I just lie all the time and it feels horrible and I feel embarrassed. I feel like there’s something wrong with me. 

Every time I watch shows or movies I always see these two cute femme lesbians that just run into each other in the wild and I’m like... how does that even happen...I don’t even think I’ve ever met another lesbian.

5920,I'm still feeling flabbergasted over something I read today about Straight Pride. CW: Homophobia,"So I had the misfortune to stumble into a debate about Straight Pride today,  and a cishet dudebro claiming it wasn't anti LGBT and was actually for straight people to 'reclaim their orientation' because gay people were bullying them.  Also because straight 'felt guilty' about being straight. 

The justification the dudebro made for Straight Pride was that cishet people were being bullied and discriminated against by LGBT folx, and they wanted to 'reclaim' their pride in their orientation. He claimed LGBT folx had become what they wanted to destroy. Even hours later I'm still fucking flabbergasted by it. He's essentially claiming cishet folks are being oppressed on the same fucking widespread systematic level LGBT people are, and that the LGBT community is responsible for it. We don't have the numbers, the social capital, the systems, the political clout, and we sure as fuck don't have queerness as the fucking default. How the hell can we even remotely be oppressing these idiots? His cited examples? Gay people talking shit about cishets on the internet was oppression.

5921,A positive and wholesome story,"I really wanted to share this somewhere.

I have a five year old daughter (my only thanks to comp het) and she's so used to being around lesbian couples that it has never been something we even needed to discuss. She was the flower girl at my best friends' wedding so she already gets the concept of two wives.

She has this book my friend gave her when she was a toddler called Worm Loves Worm, about two worms who get married and each page breaks down gender roles and traditions and how they can both wear a hat/tux/dress or whatever. It's a very cute children's book.

Yesterday morning I woke up to the book on top of me and her saying excitedly she wanted to take it to school for her teacher to read to her class (something the teacher encourages them to do). My first reaction was ""hmm do you want to pick a different book?"" I was afraid of her disappointment if her teacher chose not to read it. But like any other five year old she insisted on it, and horrified by my initial response, I told her she was right and it was a fantastic book to share.

So when I picked her up from school I asked her how the book went and she excitedly told me her teacher read it and loved it and so did her class. 

My girlfriend is from a very religious family and culture and I always tell her the best thing we can do is normalize it by the courage we show and the choices we make every day.

5940,Gf got mad at me after I got mad at her over her wearing my clothes,"Hey yall

So for some context this is my first real relationship and I'm not used to everything that goes on in one. Also when growing up I was an only child and was pretty isolated socially so I don't know that much about women's culture or lesbian culture ( like expectations, everything. )

So after having a isolated childhood/teenage year/ early 20s I have gotten my first serious relationship and admittedly she moved in too fast ( i sort of manage a house and needed to fill a room, we had been friends for years at this point but only about a month or 2 into our relationship )

More recently she's been wearing more of my clothes started with socks, shirts, boyshorts, shoes, sweats then jackets. I'm feeling why is she wearing all my clothes and why cant she just use her own. I say this because i can't find my sweats when i want to use them anymore. She's using my hella expensice rain jacket ( that i admittedly don't use ) and i don't want her to use it because after a while the clothes just become her clothes. I have lost some amount of clothes to this process. 

She reasoning is in that every relationship she has been in she always shared clothes amd got hella mad at me when i got annoyed at her. 

The most recent event was over a belt. I was looking for my belt the past few days aince i was tired of my pants sorta sagging. Last night i found them on her pants and her explaination was that it was sitting on a shelf for a week so she used it. I gave her one of my old belts in the past because she was lacking a belt and i let her use this belt because she's running for office and had a debate and my belt looked nicer. And i had to use the belt i ""gave"" her in the past.

5944,I *really* Want to Hang at Her Place but Have a History of Assault and Sometimes Freeze Up- Any Advice on How to Approach this??,"Ok, so met this really cute girl at the climbing gym. Flirt a bit, she totally picks up on it, calls me out, cute banter ensues :) She snags my number. I get home and she shoots me a really sweet text about how she had a great night and is looking fwd to getting to know me. We've been texting the past few days A LOT. Just random, long convos about hobbies, music, etc. Actually having to pull back a bit bc it's eating up so much time! Flirting a ton too, which I'm really into honestly. I can be pretty uh....yeah, not subtle, and she's kind of the same. Like, it's really nice, lots of good feelings and I really do want to cuddle, kiss her, everything. 

We're climbing tomo night and very likely hanging at her place afterward. I'm really excited at the prospect. I'm having so many good feelings. But here's the downer. I have a history of rape and sometimes really freeze up, even when I'm w/ someone I really like. It can be really misleading too, bc I'll be totally fine, flirting, sensual, into it, and then boom. It's especially hard when it comes to anything beyond kissing/cuddling. 

I am seeing a therapist to deal with the trauma. However, I'm really unsure of how this may come up tomo. I don't want to come across as a tease being all physical and affectionate, but then being unable to go any further. I think if I really get to know someone and feel safe, I absolutely could go further, but that takes time too. Maybe saying something like ""Hey, I really want to hang with you tonight, but I tend to go a bit slow in some areas. Sex can be a bit complicated for me, but I'd really like to just spend time and be with you tonight."" 

Has anyone else had to deal with this? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",actuallesbians,1578622577,millenium_fulcrum,,1,True,2020-01-09

 I popped the lyrics into google translate and came up with some sweet sentiments... maybe someone with the dual tongue can impart the wisdom upon us.

Quisiera ser el canto que te anima  
Quisiera ser el rizo de tu pelo  
Quisiera ser tu séptimo sentido  
Quisiera ser el sueño de tu ombligo, oh

Quisiera, oh oh  
Quisiera

Quisiera que me hablaras cuando callas  
O al menos ser el nudo en tu garganta  
Quisiera ser la silla que te aguanta  
Tu zafacón de besos escondidos

Y prender el alba  
Y amasar la noche  
Y salir contigo  
Disfrazado de horizonte

Quisiera y tantas cosas más quisiera  
Quisiera y tantas cosas más quisiera  
Quisiera, oh  
Quisiera

Quisera ser el asa a de tus ojos  
El calcio que te da tus vitaminas  
Tu ruta cuando cruzas la neblina  
Y el cordón umbilical de tus zapatos

Y contar contigo  
Y tocar las calles  
Y sembrar guayabas  
Y soñar con mil detalles  
Revelar tus ojos  
Celebrar tu nombre  
Y salir…",actuallesbians,1578622927,halite_snacks,,1,True,2020-01-09

5951,"Is it appropriate to mention same sex relationships to strange children? If so, to what degree and how?","Hellurr,

I am a lesbian living in Atlanta. For those who don't know, Atlanta has a sizeable black community and a sizeable Evangelical community. For those who dont know, both of those communities have lots of homophobic ideologies floating around. Enough so that when I am outside of my queer spaces I feel the need to erase my relationship when having casual discussions with others to avoid offending someone. 

This fear changes how I engage with my partner in public and leads to me telling white lies to avoid my truth.

I am most at a lost as to what is appropriate when I am around the children of other people. Sometimes kids probe about my relationship status or even as simple as what I do on any given day and I have created this whole world in which I do not mention my relationship to avoid saying something that the kid will report to their parents then come to fight with me about. 

Long story short: Would it be inappropriate to mention my partner casually when asked? Nothing pushy just the same energy one woud do in a cishet-ship: 

For ex,

Child I Nanny: Is that your dog? 

Me: Yes (a lie)

what I wish I could say: No its my girlfriends.

5955,I need to break up with my gf and I feel like an asshole due to my reasonings. Advice!,"I’ve been dating my gf for about 5 months now. I truly do care about her and she’s a lovely person. However, over these past months I’ve learned we’re not on the same path in life. She’s two years older than me but im a lot ahead and have my life together(don’t mean to sound arragont), where as she does not. when we first met she told me she was in her last year of college and would be graduating in the spring, along with getting her teaching credentials. It didn’t bother me at the time because she seemed driven, had goals, and there was a plan in place for her life. Which is all I ask for in a partner. Shortly after, I started to notice she wasn’t this ambitious person I thought she was. She complained about school every day, didn’t want to go or sometimes wouldn’t. Would do poor on test because she’d rather do other fun stuff than study. As much as it annoyed me I always encouraged her to stay focus and to stay in school because she’s so close to being done. Since I’ve known her she’s taken a test she must pass in order to receive her credential at least 4 times and cannot pass it. She always threatens to give up but I still encourage her to try and study more, which is something else she doesn’t do. Now, she cannot graduate for at LEAST a year, and that’s still only if she passes this test. I just can’t wait that long for someone to establish their life. It makes it even harder that’s shes pretty in love with me and seems to think there’s no worry in the world as long as I’m around. Anytime I try to talk about her future she immediately will say things like “I’m so happy I have you In my life”, “you’re the only person of gets me through the day”.  It can get frustrating. Things clearly aren’t going to improve for awhile and I’m not sure how to end things.

5959,Idk what to do,"So idk what to do about coming out to my family in the rather distant future. I was planning that when I move out I’d come out. But I start to think, (like usual cause I’m an oVerThInKeR) I actually have a pretty close relationship with my family and friends even though I’m a rather distant person. So I would love to come out to my family and friends... however most of my friends and all of my family are homophobic Christians. Just today in school actually I asked my friend what she thought about the lgbtq+ community and she said that she thought it was disgusting, this really bothered me because I was actually planning on coming out to her later in that class period. Also, just last month I was doing some Christmas shopping with my stepmom dad stepsister and niece, my stepsis was going through her Facebook and she was talking about this one girl and showed her mom (my stepmom) a picture of a girl with her girlfriend and they continued to talk about how disgusting it would be to have to tell your young kids that their mom is gay. (cause the girl had been recently divorced with her husband and had kids with him I believe) 

so I just really don’t know what to do about coming out. I have some time cause I’m still pretty young, I have a few years until I turn 18. I was wondering if anyone who’s had similar issues could give me any advice? I’m just kinda lost rn and it really bothers me that I have to keep this from my best friend. Im scared of ruining any relationships I have with people cause honestly I would have no one if it wasn’t for my best friend and I wouldn’t have anywhere to go without my family, I don’t want to have bad relationships with anyone I care about ya know?

5967,A discussion on exclusion/proper terminology,"I apologize for the formatting as I am on mobile and I normally don't start serious topics, but I though some additional opinions might be useful here. 


Essentially my Nonbinary Lesbian friend stayed over at my place for a few days in an effort to hang out more before they leave for Texas this year. For whatever reason as soon as we met this time around they were extremely political right off the bat going on about numerous topics. These ranged from condescendingly obvious to outrageous misrepresenting facts, but that's fine, I just tried my best to be polite and change the subject as much as possible. 


This post is in response to one topic in particular that I am not sure how to feel about: needing more exclusion in the use of the term Lesbian. My friend went on to great lengths to disparage straight girls, bi girls, and pretty much anyone who was not pure 100% girls only using this term. They went on to use examples of straight girls claiming to be lesbian to stop guys from hitting on them and bi-girls using the term lesbian on social media, only to later be seen in public with a guy; How that causes men to disregard the term as fake and how some lesbians feel unsafe using the term due to that. 


Now there was alcohol that night so I do not recall all the details of their one sided argument, but from what I recall it sounds like their problem should be with these kind of men and not the girls  using the Lesbian label. Am I missing something important about this argument? 


So this post is mostly me wanting to hear other opinions on this. Is using the lesbian label when you like nonbinary, queer, or men not ok? Does it really cause harm in our community? Or do you believe the exact opposite and that gatekeeping the label is harmful? 


Tl;Dr: I am hoping this post can be a civil discussion about the Lesbian label, if misuse of it is harmful or if gatekeeping it is harmful or both? I really want to hear other opinions and arguments so I can firmly take a side on this issue if I need to.",actuallesbians,1578636110,PhoenixHavoc,,1,True,2020-01-10

While obviously I recognize that not having periods is pretty convenient, I still wish I could have them. Not being able to have periods is yet another thing in a long list of things that permanently separate me from what I want to be.

6002,| Another Winter Night |,"It was the second time that I had to check on our Little One.  She started screaming, out of nowhere in the middle of the night, so I had to move My Tightly Sleeping Wife a bit,... had to grab a shirt, probably hers,, Can't remember exactly and then I left to our Little Ones room.  I was holding our crying Tiny Thing for a while and once she fell asleep, I kept her in her little crib hoping she'd sleep.

I stepped back quietly Cause I didn't want to wake my other Little Toddler too. If it happens she wants all of us to sleep on our bed together. Nothing can stop her. Everyone in this family wants Cuddles. But I can't complain, can I?  I looked at my Adorable Blobs and Kissed them both so softly.

I came back to my wife who was so annoyed Cause she couldn't find my chest to sleep. After all these years she still can't sleep without me, so I literally have 3 babies in this house.  Then I cuddled my sweet babe, kissed her cheeks,  yes ... her bubbly pinky cheeks..
.... Then she asked in a horny voice,... 

""Where did you go baby.. "" 

Then I was like, how come every night she asks the same question? ...

"" Beiiiiibe,, Do you even remember that we have 2 Blobs?  We got Married... We Moved to our Little Farm House... Babe..  Have you forgotten everything ? ""

I was teasing her.. 

She Suddenly Looked at me, kept her Face on my Lips.. I felt her Heart Beat, her nude chest was Pressed against mine.. I wrapped my legs around her thighs softly ... 

But.. She was Giggling... So I  was confused and asked.. 

""Wait whaaaat?  You seriously can't remember? ""

She waited for a minute and Kissed my Neck and said... "" Nope. I thought We are  in Bali Islands, Our Honeymoon Cottage ""

6010,What’s the best way to ask out a customer?,"TL;DR I want to ask a customer out but I’m not sure how to do it without making her uncomfortable. She’s also always with her mother. 

I am not sure what to do. I‘m attracted to a girl who shops at my store. I think she knows it too. Sometimes she will come in and stand right next to me or on the opposite side of the table I’m working on. It doesn’t really look like she’s looking for anything either. She also always comes in with her mother even though I’m sure she’s at least my age, if not older.

A few weeks ago she came in with her mom and a guy was with them, I’m not sure if he was her brother or boyfriend since I’ve never seen him with them before. It was strange because her mom and the guy that was with them went in the back to go shop while she was in my department looking around. Which isn’t too weird, I work in the clothing department, but I’d like to believe she split from them as a way to give us a chance to talk, which didn’t happen, but I’m not sure. I’ve actually been avoiding her, when I see her coming I’ll leave and go somewhere else. 

How do I strike up a conversation with her when she never really says anything? I don’t want to make her uncomfortable. Should I write my number down and give it to her the next time she comes in or would that seem too premeditated and creepy?",actuallesbians,1577925117,Xheq1222,,1,True,2020-01-01

6012,I made my girlfriend cry and doubt our relationship (pls read all the way through),"Hey I guess I need a space to vent and so I made a second account to do just that. I recently came to terms that I am bisexual, after living my entire life as a seemingly straight woman. There was someone in my life that I fell for, and we started dating and have been really happy together. Last night, while watching a movie, a baby came on the screen. I told my girlfriend “That baby is adorable. I can’t wait to be a mom and experience the beauty of pregnancy.” My girlfriend didn’t really say anything and was quiet after that. Finally on our way to bed, I asked her what was wrong. She broke down in tears and said that she knows I want nothing more than to be a mom, but she’s knows that she can’t give that to me. She knows we have to go through a complicated process if we ever ended up together that long. And she said that she is scared that because she can’t make me happy in that way, that I’ll leave and eventually get to live the life I wanted, carrying someone else’s child. This came out of nowhere and I tried to assure her that I wasn’t ready to be a mom anytime soon, and that if we are still living happily like we are now, we can figure all of that out in time. I was caught off guard at how badly she reacted to a simple comment. I don’t know what to do because I know she is still thinking about it, and all the odds. I’d love some advice because I’m currently stumped.",actuallesbians,1577927227,majesticangel1038,,1,True,2020-01-01

This girl I'm seeing claims that my playing the flute has had an impact on my.. ahem... stamina(?) in bed. She is convinced that because I use my fingers and mouth everyday when I play music, it's reflected in my sex capabilities.

I mean it's always nice to get a compliment, but It just feels a bit weird to associate my work life and sex life like that.. also, now I can't help thinking that I've basically been training to become a lesbian since I was 10 years old, hah.

6016,confused,"I loved women ever since I can remember. I just really didn’t know what kind of admiration it was in the beginning. As a kid, I thought that my first girl crush, at 12 years old, was just a regular feeling anyone got when ever they’re around pretty girls, who you’d enjoy to make laugh. When I was 16 and in high school, I fell in love with my best friend’s friend. Her friend and I kissed and the rest is history. At 16 I was able to confirm that I am in fact capable of falling in love with a woman. Now I’m 24, and as much as I love woman it’s hard to see myself marrying a woman, bringing our families together, and growing old together. It makes me feel lost when ever I think about turning old with a woman. 

I love woman, I’ve fallen in love with a woman. I see myself falling in love again with a woman. But anything more than that scares me. It’s not the commitment that scares me.

I've been having a lot of unfortunate events happening to me ever since we broke up, and I guess I just miss how I acted before things went downhill. I got really toxic after the emotional abuse I went through with different people and my family, so I'm taking a break from dating.

We run through the empty village as our hair flies elegantly in the wind, the sun beginning to retreat behind the many houses and smiles plastered on our faces. Our feet slip on the gravel as we approach a soft stream. She reaches down and cups a small amount of water in her hands and brings it to her face, causing the sun to glisten on all the right parts, enhancing her impeccable beauty. Our speed picks up as we come towards a large field, with trees not too far in the background, daisies and lavender plants growing effortlessly across the deep green grass. We fall down to the floor, out of breath and laughing, as the sunset catches the beauty in her honey eyes as her gaze meets mine. We sit there for what seems like forever and just watch the deep orange and pink sky fade into a purple sea and eventually a dark night sky with stars scattered across it like milk dripping from a cat's whiskers. Our lips meet softly and her hand tightens around mine as we drift off into our own fantasy land, safe in eachothers gentle embrace.

6040,Sooo I finally came out to one of my friends after being closeted for a couple years around them,"Hi, I needed to talk about this with someone and felt that this could be the place to do it. I've been having a hard time because two years ago I started hanging out with some friends from church (i'm christian) but I never came out to them bc I was afraid of them judging me or something, which made me really sad, like if I had to wear a mask to be around them or pretend to be something I'm not. I already came out to my family and friends as bisexual almost 10 years ago, when I was 15, but in the last year I noticed that the past relationships I had with men always ended up because I couldn't feel attracted to them. I recently knew about the term ""comphet"" (my native language is spanish and we don't have a term for that, lol) and I identified it so much to what happened to me when I dated guys. Like, I have a lot of things in common with guys and that made me feel confused about liking them.   
I realized that I've never been confused about women, when I dated girls I was really sure about it ♥ and talking to my best friend (we're friends since 2010 so he's like my brother and knows everything about me) he told me that he noticed the same thing about my past relationships :P. So I came out as a lesbian to him and I felt so much freedom that I didn't have before.   
Then I started worrying about my christian friends and how could I tell them. I was really scared to tell them because a couple of months ago I had a talk about sexuality with a friend from church and I noticed that he's pretty homophobic. They're such cool, loving people and open minded about stuff that other religious communities wouldn't accept, but there are other things (like sexuality or mental health) in which they are pretty conservative. Today I could talk with one of them about it; he first asked me if I'm sure about my feelings towards women, and when I said that I am, he told me that no matter what I feel, I am loved by them. I felt so accepted and loved that I needed to share it with someone :)    
I feel happy about what my friend has told me, but I still feel like there is a lot to do about accepting LGBTQ+ people in church, like, not all the people in church is like him and I'm still afraid of telling other friends.   
Are any of you christian or religious and have experienced fear about coming out to the people of your community? any advice on that?

So there's this girl from my class I met four months ago. At first, she seemed pretty chill. We never really talked except to work on school projects and assignments. Day in day out, we suddenly become inseparable. She then starts to show signs that she's interested:
1. holds eye contact longer than usual, looks at my lower body while talking to me
2. touches my hand, my elbow, sometimes rests her hand on my shoulder. Simple things like that
3. always hangs around me
4. I catch her staring at me from a distance many, many times
5. looks out for me and always down to help me out
6. we sometimes sit together in silence and she just stares at me with longing in her eyes and I can feel this tension in the air (BIGGEST SIGN THAT MADE ME QUESTION THINGS)
One day, I come out to her, and she says she already suspected that anyway. Some time later, I figure out that her ""guy friend"" is actually her longtime boyfriend. So, I give up on this crush of mine and decide to move on (if she has a boyfriend she's probably straight, right??)... until she tells me she's bisexual.

Now, I don't know what to do anymore. I was already planning on moving on but finding out that she's bisexual has me all confused. What if she's subconsciously attracted to me?

6045,Why do parents have to ruin everything????,This isn’t about my parent (my mom) who is a bisexual goddess who is super supportive but rather my girlfriend’s parents. So we’re in high school and we started dating recently after months of me crushing hard. So thats amazing and im happy and shes SO cute. But her parents are kinda iffy. We were face timing and her mom started walking up the stairs and she just ends the call. And so im confused but she explains that her mom was near and so im like okay shes never dated a girl before so shes just nervous. And she explained that her parents wouldn’t let us see each other if they knew. So today they found out because she told her little sister (super young) outed her to her parents. My girlfriend had told her sister about her crush on me before we started dating. So over dinner her family was saying it was weird she hadn’t dated in awhile. So her little sister was like ‘she said she likes (me)’. So now shes upset because she knows this is going to turn into them checking her phone every night and not letting us do stuff together. And they’ve done this with her past boyfriends which makes dating seem so stressful for her. I just think its really unfair and hurtful towards her development as a young girl who is figuring herself out and dating another girl. Which in high school is already stressful.

She even said “wait—I have some makeup of my own” and pulled out a little plastic baggy of 10 year old makeup from a drawer, which I found cute because she was trying to help 😭 Luckily I carry a pretty decent selection of makeup in my overnight bag!

We went in the bathroom and I mixed a few foundation colors and put it on her just to get a sense of what it would look/feel like. We were laughing the whole time, it was pretty cute (although I did knock the shower curtain rod down, oops).

6051,"Want to chop my hair off, but...","I've been toying around with the idea of cutting my hair short lately, and for a few reasons. I'm finally out to my friends, coworkers and family and truly embracing who I really am. Cutting my hair short feels almost like an affirmation of how I feel inside. But on top of that I can't stand brushing and styling my long hair, it's always shedding and I don't want to embody a feminine presentation anymore. I'm just worried that the cut won't flatter my face shape and I'll get shit from people who ""prefer me with long hair"".. I get that I should do what I want and what makes me happy but I'm honestly conflicted. Anyone else here who cut their hair short after coming out? Advice, tips on how to choose a style? How did you clap back at people who said they prefer your hair long, or who said you cut it short just to ""prove you're a lesbian""?

6057,To the woman who assaulted me at the only gay bar in town,"Last night was New Years Eve. I was out with my girlfriend, my best friend, and my best friends boyfriend. I live in Florida, in a town with one gay bar. We also happen to hold the country's largest Pride celebration on a beach. 

We get out to the bar around 10:30. We're old souls, so none of us wanted to be out late or for long.

We are having one of the best nights of the year. My girlfriend and I are having a great time together, as well as our friends. This night just couldn't get better. 

But it could get worse.

Midnight has struck. We ring in the new year kissing our lovers and dancing as if we're the only people on the planet. My girlfriend steps to the bar to pay our tab, not five feet away. We're standing close to a busy walkway, so from where I'm standing, I'm on the opposite side of the walkway from her. 

A crowd of people comes through, and to be honest I'm not paying much attention to any of them considering I have the most beautiful girlfriend in existence. 

At the back of the crowd, I noticed one of the girls stopped in front of me. She is looking at me, so I notice and glance back just as she started to say something. I don't catch what she says because of the loud music and people, but the next thing I know is she's leaning toward me, trying to kiss me.

I feel her touch my shoulder, and try to slide the strap to my tank top off of my shoulder. I move my head just in time to miss her kiss, and feel her tongue on my cheek. I push her away, tell her I have a girlfriend, and look towards the bar. 

Only to see my girlfriend looking back, crushed. 

From her angle, she can only see the back of this mystery woman, and since I'm out of her sight, it looks to her like we're kissing.

I did not ask for this. I have never seen this woman in my life. This one woman managed to ruin such an incredible night with just one uncalculated decision. 


Ladies, I know we don't think about it often, but other women can be predators, too. Consent is so important in every form, and that includes two women. Think before you kiss a stranger. While it may seem innocent to you, it may turn someone else's life upside down.

And now my girlfriend and I have trouble feeling safe in the one bar in town where we're supposed to.",actuallesbians,1577947429,bonshotfirst,,1,True,2020-01-02

I don't drink at all so how would I fit in with all these students that drink beer  on a daily basis and 2. I am a shy person and it takes me some time to get used to people so going there is a big risk for my social anxiety and so I thought I could ask my friend that I just meet  to go with me but that would require me explaining to her where we are going ( only 3 people know what I feel and 2 of them are my online friends and 1 I don't even talk to cuz we just stopped talking so basically I am kinda alone in this ) so I don't know what to do.

ANYWAYS, i love being dominated and eaten out and stuff like that and i don't have a problem being the dominant but (and i know this sounds sooooo selfishhhhh) i really want her to eat me out :((( she only did it once :'( and it lasted like 2 songs max [TT.TT](https://TT.TT) and it's funny because when we first started going out i was a bottom and she was a top but the tables have turned and now it's all her and nothing for me. Again, i know i sound very selfish but we are very sexual and even my love language is physical touch so i guess i'm not feeling loved because she is not reciprocating?? and idk maybe i am being selfish, but also maybe she didn't like how i tasted or something like that but idk i took a shower right before she did it and everything was shaved and clean. basically she hasn't gone down since that one day and she always talks about how she'll do it but when it comes time it's always me doing everything. 

BTW i am sorry if my post is a mess i feel like i was repeating myself a lot lol

Anyways how do i approach this situation?? i don't want her to feel pressured to eat me out, i want her to do it because she wants to do it but at this point i'm losing hope and i think i might just buy toys to satisfy myself or something. At the same time i just wishhh she'd doooo ittt :'''(((( I know most people are just gonna tell me to talk to her but you have nooo idea i've been dropping hints like crazy, i'm always telling her how i love getting eaten out and i even asked her several times if she can eat me out but she always says oo yea i'll do later or not rn, stuff like that, there's always an excuse. i really do not want her to feel forced into it but it's honestly just making me feel shitty about myself at this point sooo should i have a serious talk with her or just patiently wait for her? and pls lmk how i should bring it up tooo because i don't want to sound aggressive",actuallesbians,1577953253,sunflower1315,,1,True,2020-01-02

As some of y'all know I have a small gaming YouTube. I play sims atm, mostly building, but i'm starting lets plays soon.

1. What is a good way (in your opinion) to bring in a gay character into a lets play?

As I want to bring LGBT characters into my series, but I don't want people to feel like I'm ""shoving it down their throats"" and send anymore anger towards our community.

2. How would y'all like to be represented? In your opinion. As we are all different and I want to take everyone's opinions into consideration.

Then when it comes to Reddit and a lot of messages end up being ""I'm a guy... But"".  And it's like um there's no ""But"" you're not a guy and I'm a lesbian it ain't going to work out guy.

1. My sex drive is much lower than hers.

6097,Feeling a lot of guilt/shame about sex,"I travelled for Nye to visit some friends. I don't know how to give a short summary of my dating experience but it hasn't been that great. I hadn't been with a man all of 2019 and came out again as a lesbian this time to my mother this summer. Something really strange came over me when I arrived here. I have no interest in dating/hookups usually, I get very easily attached as well but i downloaded tinder for some strange reason. This city is very liberal and very fun, just a nice escape from home so I wanted to try something. I broke up with my ex girlfriend in June, it was not a good relationship and a pretty bad breakup so it's been hard on me. I had been getting a lot of attention from men, there was even a guy in my hostel that was very flirty with me and I liked the attention, I wanted to hook up with a guy. 

So it's Nye, and I invite a guy over, bear in mind I'm staying in a hostel and I have roommates and I'm in a bunk bed so it's not exactly the most sexy setting. The guy came, we chatted maybe 10/15 mins, drank some beer and he starts pulling me close. I was really nervous and a bit scared but I had wanted to do it. The sex itself wasn't that good at all, it was really painful as I wasn't set and I just felt bored during it, very much in my head and worrying about someone walking but also focusing on trying to cum but I wasn't feeling it at all. Afterwards he left really soon. I felt really gross and didn't know why I wanted to do it. I had been thinking about it a lot but as it was New year's Eve I was very distracted and I went clubbing later. 

Yesterday I went on another tinder hookup but with a girl, she picked me up took me to her place in a cab which is in the outskirts of the city. I'm not in my country so I was a bit anxious about being so far away from my hostel. She was really nice, we watched Netflix, we then smoked which made me a bit more anxious. She fucked me, she didn't take her clothes off at all actually. I don't mind that tho. It was really nice and lots of kissing and I felt really good. In the morning she was really sweet and let me rest before I head back. But I started crying when I was getting dressed. I don't know why. I think cos I really enjoyed myself, she was so nice too and it sucks that I'm leaving the city tomorrow. She was very accommodating of me too. Everything just felt very overwhelming, along with my recent experience with a man. I cried a lot,on the bus,on the street, by the time I got to my friend's place I was sobbing hysterically. I don't know what's wrong with me. I don't know why I tried to make myself have sex with a man although I'm always disappointed. I don't know why I cried after being with this girl. I'm sorry this post is all over the place but my head is very all over the place. I feel really dirty and like a whore the way I got fucked a guy I spent 40 mins with and then I feel odd that I spend the evening and beginning of the afternoon with a girl who was super cool but I may never see again.",actuallesbians,1577984285,sensei_saitama7,,1,True,2020-01-02

Almost 25 and haven't had much luck. I wish the lesbian community was bigger. Oh well. I really don't NEED a relationship. I'm kind of selfish anyway in the sense that I like being able to do anything in life without having to work it out with someone else. Like I could move across the country and it would affect no one else. My opinion would probably change on this if I actually fell in love, but as it stands now, I kind of like being able to do what I want without having to consider someone else.

6129,I'm going to be legally emancipated from my homophobic parents!,"I have a couple of friends on here that I've talked to about wanting to do this, but I'M GOING TO BE FREE SOONER THAN I THOUGHT!

My mom and I got into a huge argument over my sexuality and she threatened to kick me out if I didn't basically pray the gay away. I asked her why not just let me get emancipated and, surprisingly, she was okay with that! It kind of hurts that she was so willing to do it (while she celebrated over not having to 'deal with me' anymore) but I'm also very happy about it. Her (and my dad) have been very horrible to me over my sexuality, weight, mental health, and interests, and now I won't have to deal with that abuse ever again!

A friend is going to let me stay with them as long as I can buy my own groceries and pay a little bit towards rent. I also have a couple of backup plans in case staying with this friend doesn't work out. I'm starting my first part time job in a few hours and will hopefully be working full time during the summer. My mom isn't going to let me take most of the stuff in my room with me, like my bed, dressers, tv, books, most of my clothes, basically anything she can sell, but hopefully I can slowly replace them in the future.

I'm also not going to fight my mom over keeping most of my stuff. A lot of things in my room are connected to bad memories and trauma. I'd honestly rather not taken those things with me anyway. If I could, I would love to just leave behind everything I don't have some form of connection to and start completely fresh, but that's not very logical you know?

6131,I think desperation for a partner is making me feel like I’m attracted to men,"I apologize if venting about this is not for this sub, but I’m honestly not sure where else to post this.

I’m an 18F and I’ve identified as a lesbian for some time now, but sometimes I doubt myself and wonder if I’m actually bisexual with a preference for women. I will see guys sometimes that I think are very kind and sweet and I feel like I could possibly date, but I’m not sure if that is just me actually thinking I’d like to be best friends with the guy or not. I think men’s faces can be attractive just as anyone would think, but the thought of having sex or even being intimate with one kind of freaks me out. But I’m not sure if that’s because I’m a lesbian or because I’m not accepting that I’m secretly attracted to men and don’t know it? It all sounds like a bunch of compulsory heterosexuality, but who knows. 

A couple months ago my friend suggested maybe turning on the everyone setting on dating apps and seeing how I felt, and within the day I felt extremely anxious and uncomfortable and I deleted my entire account because I didn’t want to interact with those guys because I was thinking “I’m a lesbian! Why am I forcing myself to be attracted to these guys?” But it’s like, what if I am? Most girls when they realize they’re gay probably feel this way towards girls, but what if it’s the opposite for me towards guys?

I feel like a lot of it too is that I desperately want a girlfriend, but every girl I’ve met since my ex has been a genuinely awful person. They’ve admitted to having someone on the side, not being over an ex, or just reveal some qualities that I could never get past. All of my friends are girls who are either straight or bisexual, and they always seem to meet great guys who don’t treat them like dirt and I’ve always just had bad luck with girls. Even my bisexual friends seem to have better luck with guys for this same reason; a lot of the girls they’ve met have just turned out to be awful people. I feel like I want a relationship like my friends have so badly that it makes me think that being with guys are the answer, but I’m not attracted to guys, I want a girl who can treat me kindly.

For the first time in years I was totally smitten by a girl from first glance. She was DEFINITELY out of my league at the time, but we would always made prolonged eye contact and she even introduced herself with a friend and ate lunch with me. A few weeks after that I saw her around campus and thought I would shoot my shot and gave her my number but she never messaged me so I kinda just assumed that all of her advances were friendly bc I also saw her on tinder and we never matched :/. Fast forward about year and we end up at the same place and the eye contact is intense, I’ve also lost around 35 lbs since I last saw her, so I wasn’t sure if she was just tryna to recognize me. She talked to me that night after we stared each other down for hours and it was obvious that there was some nervousness from both of us. 
NOW about a month later I go to my friends shindig and as soon as I walk in she’s at the door and our mutual friend introduces me to everyone their and we kinda sheepishly smile at each other and say hey. Like 15 mins into being there I decide to go up and talk to her not really expecting much out of the interaction but she’s being really responsive and into the conversation and almost immediately asks for my number. The rest of the night we were mainly together dancing and flirting and towards the end of the night I ask her how she’s feeling and she tells me “you look fucking hot and I kinda wanna kiss you right now” so ofc I’m super shocked and she leads me outside and we start making out until the party gets shut down a few mins later. While we’re standing around for her uber hugging she tells me that she liked kissing me and I said me too and we kissed goodbye. 
Okay so that was a GREAT night but the issue is I texted her two days later basically telling her that I would like to see her and she responded that she thought I had a great laugh and would love to ask me to hangout when she was back from vacation. She told me the specific date she’d back and and said she will text me. Also I know that shes been seeing dude from her hometown for over a year now but idk if it’s a serious/open relationship thingy. She seems really into me but idk if it was just a one night type of thing or if I’m even a priority (she’s pretty popular/social unlike me)

6143,"My gaydar is the worst, I didn’t even see that *I* was gay.","When I was like 12, there was this girl at school. She was in her last year (around 18 y/o) and we never talked, I didn’t know her name and I don’t think she’s ever noticed me but I went out of my way to catch the same train as her in the mornings, I spent my breaks just staring at her walking around and existing, I thought about her every day, all the time. I didn’t tell anyone anything about it, though. I don’t even know why, but I wanted to keep it to myself.

Then she got together with this guy and I remember the moment I’ve seen them both make out in the hallway for the first time. And I’ve got a *really* bad memory, usually. I can’t remember shit. I don’t even know what our classrooms looked like. But I have a crazy clear memory of this scene, where they were standing and on which floor it was and mostly, how this was the WORST feeling I’ve ever experienced so far. My stomach just dropped and my heart *broke* and I wanted to die. I just walked into the next room and sat down and started crying.
My friends came after me but I didn’t say anything, I was so shocked and overwhelmed. 

So, you’d think by then I MUST have known I was into her right?? I mean, I started my emo career right there and then. I went home and sobbed and listened to sad music where men yelled a lot and I told my parents they didn’t get me and I refused to go to school and then I started being late all the time because I didn’t want to see her in the mornings. 

But did I know it? No. I genuinely thought, while I was *sobbing* into my pillows, that I was very much into her new *boyfriend* who until then I had never noticed. He was a year younger than her. After she graduated I forgot about him immediately, literally forgot. I didn’t even *wonder* why I got over him so quickly. He was invisible for the entire next year. 

I’m in my mid twenties now and only RECENTLY realized this was a crush. Actually I was still having doubts until I thought about it a few minutes ago when I saw a post that reminded me of It. I really thought I just wanted to look like her and was now just desperately trying to find proof that I’m actually a lesbian and didn’t make it up as an adult. 

Guys. I DREW PICTURES OF HER FACE IN THE EVENINGS. I STARTED CRYING WHEN SHE KISSED A GUY.

From there on out she would always strike up a convo as we walk to the parking lot together. I try to back off as I know she’s in a relationship. The flirtatious glances and walks continue but she occasionally mentions her “boyfriend”. This has been going on for weeks. What on earth is going on here?

6156,Was anyone really homophobic before they found out they were a lesbian?,"This may be a bit long since I'll be talking about how I discovered my identity. Share your gay awakenings as well!

When I was growing up, I always had a lot of trouble fitting in. It's mostly because from pre-k - 5th grade I barely talked to anyone or made friends. I wanted that to change in middle school, but due to lack of experience, I still ending up being an outcast with poor socializing skills.

Anyways, at this age I was very susceptible to peer pressure and group-think. When I found out homosexuality was a thing in 6th grade, it blew my mind. I never thought it was possible for the two men or two women to have feelings for each other.  I knew it was unpopular so I voiced my opposition to it and was quite the homophobe.

But what bugged the hell out of me was that several of my classmates thought I was a lesbian. Maybe I acted in a stereotypical way without knowing it. The school had uniform so it couldn't have been the way I dressed...The gaydar is real you guys  ;-; 

Speaking of stereotypes, I joined the basketball team in 7th grade. This is where I had my awakening. 

It was the first day of tryouts and I was in line for one of the basketball drills. I felt someone tap me on my shoulder so I turned around. There were no words to describe what happened next. Okay here are some words though: It was like one of those scenes in a movie when an attractive person is shown. I kid you not, the whole world around her disappeared and instead her background was tinted yellow. Her hair was blowing elegantly in the wind. She was the most beautiful girl I've ever seen in my life. Butterflies had danced in my stomach. I was by all means mesmerized. I think she said hi to me or something. After I came to my senses, I didn't even say hi back. I just turned around and was like *eh, pretty girl whatever...*

But I think this girl definitely got the impression that I was into her. I wonder how I must have looked gawking at her like that, geezus...

For the rest of my time on the basketball team she was constantly teasing me in a seductive way. Full body hugs, the eye contact, even just playing extra close defense on me, which distracted me from running the plays correctly. I would melt from a slight touch or even just glancing at her, it was nuts. But I still convinced myself that I wasn't gay. More so because I didn't want to be even more of an outcast than I already was.

The gay rumors continued. Apparently my homophobic words weren't convincing anybody, so I went ahead and got a boyfriend to ward off the rumors. I felt nothing the whole time I was with him. We only kissed once and I held my tongue back during it. I also went straight to the bathroom to wash my mouth. Talk about a shitty first kiss. He apparently enjoyed it though. I wondered why people even kissed after that. It just felt like kissing a wall and a little gross because this wall has a tongue.

In high school, it became apparent to me that I fit more in the category of MoC and/or stem. And I was very attracted to feminine women. It irked me sometimes how easily feminine women could convince me to do something for them. And I had chivalrous urges I couldn't push away. I developed an unhealthy addiction to gay porn (guy on guy) at the time. Why was I into gay men porn? I have no clue. I still have regrets of missed love opportunities in high school. There were some very obvious signs some girls were giving me, that I didn't catch until I was at home thinking about my day.

Whenever we had conversations about gay folk in high school, I was never supportive of them. I didn't think they should show PDA or be on kids shows. I also believed they were going to hell (I was Christian). 

In college, I loosened up a bit. I was learning about conspiracies, astral projection, lucid dreaming, subliminals, different realms, and came to the conclusion the world painted out by school and church is not what it seems. More is going on out there. I don't follow any religion now but the closest one is probably Wicca. I like learning about nature and spell casting. Cool stuff. 

During college, I came out to several trusted people (about being gay, not about being into witchcraft). I may come out to my folks when I'm financially independent. I don't think I'm homophobic anymore...but I've said some vulgar homophobic things when angry. I'm working on not doing that anymore. I know it's wrong. 

I still haven't dated anyone yet... I've just flirted with girls every now and then casually. I want a girlfriend eventually. There are some things I want to do before that.

Haha, it's like I wrote an essay. If you read it all, thanks for your time.

TLDR:

I was super homophobic and super gay. I started searching for the truth and got more questions about life. Then I expanded my narrow view. Still working on fully getting rid of my homophobia.",actuallesbians,1578009816,KuviraPrime,,95,True,2020-01-02
6157,How do I start dating women without coming across as an annoying and confused dumbass?,"Sooo I kinda knew for a while that I was into women as well but I’ve only recently started to consider myself pan.

I’m in my twenties, married to man, polyamorous (open/poly relationship with said man since day one), I have a lot of experience with guys but basically none with women.
I kissed a girl once when I was 18 and she said I was a horrible kisser and that kind of prevented me from seeking anything else.

Until now. I switched Tinder to “all genders” and I’m starting to match with girls but I feel super insecure about suggesting dates because I’m so new to this. I know it’s a stereotype for many people, those “confused college girls” who are just “experimenting” and don’t mean it etc (really hope I’m not stepping on anyone’s toes here, you do you, this is just something I’ve heard and read a lot). And I don’t want to come across as that. Or as an annoying thing that has to be taught everything from the beginning.

Basically, I feel like a very young teenager again and I don’t know how to communicate what I feel. Did I even explain it in a way that can be understood? Heeeeelp!

6164,Just a Clueless Closeted Bisexual Confused About if a Girl is Interested,"I am a closeted female bisexual that is also a college undergraduate. Last year I used to go to the school library every day to study or sit while waiting for classes. There’s a student that works there. I swear I saw her all the time. During that year, there was a time where I was studying at a table, and she asked if a random piece of plastic on the ground was mine. She didn’t ask it in a rude way as if she were asking if it were my trash. I just thought it was weird of her to ask if such a useless piece of plastic was mine.  

This year she still works there. I go to the library on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. Every time I’m there, this girl walks past me, last year included. It doesn’t matter where I am in the library. She works at the front desk of the library, which is near the entrance. It looks like her job is to keep the library clean and to organize books or something. Usually, I like to go downstairs and work because many people don’t go there. There are lots of tables and chairs. Usually, she comes around the tables to push in a chair or two. 

One day I decided to study and do homework in the student area where there are mainly couches, which is on the same level as the entrance/main desk but kinda a different room. I’m sitting, and then she comes and makes it look like she’s fixing a couch or something. I thought it was weird because she only “fixed” or looked at the couch in front of me. Yeah, this school year I’ve been kinda trying to sneakily watch what she does around me. Lol. What is there to fix on a couch? After that day, I continued to study in the downstairs area because I like the quietness. She still walks past my table. Another day I decide to go sit in the student area again to test her, and she walks by there again too. 

Today I was sitting downstairs in the quiet area, and she comes around pushing in chairs that are already pushed in. There’s a table across from me, and she pushes the chair in. She goes around, comes back, and pushes the chair again that was already pushed. Do you think she is trying to get my attention or am I thinking too much? I will also mention that she rarely makes eye contact with me. At this point in the school year, I think I might be interested in her. Lol, since I’ve been subtly watching her and trying to test her. I sometimes try to make eye contact with her or smile to see what she would do. 

So I saw the library girl in the hallway today. I was walking and heard someone humming so I looked back. It was her. I moved to the side and stopped walking. She walks in front of me, and then I turn and slightly walk. Then she turned back and kinda walked around me. I got flustered and dodged her every move. We basically did 360s around each other. 🤣 So we basically just had our very first awkward dance. Lol, I get around her and just walk away. 

Surprisingly, I haven’t seen the library girl in a while. I didn’t see her in the library the last couple of times I went. Today I went to the lower part of the library, and she followed about 30 seconds later. Lmao, I waited for her to come down. I subtly watched the stairs from my table. Did I do anything? No. 🤣

So I don’t have my morning class today, and I’m supposed to meet with my group to plan for a group project. We meet in the library. Guess who’s working? Library girl. So I’m sitting with the one groupmate that showed up. We’re all the way in the back of the library. As library girl walks past our table, she does a little (I don’t know the word. She did the thing where you blow air out of your nose when you’re slightly amused but not enough to laugh. It was kinda like “pshh” but a slight snort?). Throughout the whole walk, she did not look at me. Library girl always seems to find me. However, she does see me enter the library every time and knows what direction I walk in. Then she came back later to fix some chairs around us. Lol, library girl is always fixing chairs and shit around me. When she came back around, I was talking to my groupmate about guys that liked me and how I have many guy friends. At the particular moment when she was behind us fixing chairs, I was talking about an older friend that all my friends and family thought I was secretly dating but wasn’t. The project was about dating. 

After that day, I continued to see her in the library, but she stopped walking past me or fixing anything around me. Do you think she was ever interested in me?

6173,I started to fall for a girl: The only problem is that we just broke up.,"I not so recently went through my first real relationship, a toxic experience that left me detached after the 8-month course had run. it ended in Oct. And since then I was not expecting to get into a relationship. Well, I met a girl in October who understood me on a level that I thought was entirely special in and of itself. I started to have genuine feelings for her which were growing and coupled by her flirting back with me, I felt extremely good about the entire situation. 

She was extremely kind to me and I hadn't as much experienced that in the dating category. I felt myself being attached to the things she would say or even the sound of her voice which to me wasn't something I would immediately expect. She disappeared for a week in December, and I spent that time actively worried about her and trying to find a reason.

Then, when she was back, we talked and scheduled a date. On new years. 

I don't think I've ever been more excited about something in my life. I don't normally go out, I'm usually inside and alone without anyone to talk to. I felt ecstatic and euphoric about the entire thing. I was... Nervous. So excited but nervous as hell. she is the prettiest girl I think I've ever seen and I was having a string of complicated and attached feelings about the entire thing, which was a tiny bit expressed in the date. 

The entire time I was a little nervous but I felt so happy. I couldn't describe it exactly. I felt really good about it, I kissed her and it was magic like I hadn't felt before, I held her hand and it was fireworks. anything that happened felt so memorable to me. We made a joke about starting to date (officially) and then it happened: We were dating: I was again, ecstatic. 

Afterward, I noticed something was off but I didn't want to ask. I was so nervous about the entire thing that I felt a little sick because she didn't send a single text (we had texted every day since Nov.) At around 3 pm she sent me a text explaining that she wasn't in a place to be in a relationship but that we should still be friends, and I feel crushed. I broke down in front of my mom and a bunch of others because I realized I wasn't as special to her as she was to me... or just anything else.

The thing is, she told me that it was for mental health, which I myself can understand. I have experienced a lot of different hurdles with mental health which I had mentioned sparingly. I wish I could express the way I'm feeling. But I don't know how to. 

I started to fall for her. Which is stupid for someone I had known for two months. But still. It had started. And I feel extremely sad right now because I want to be with her and go on more dates. 

I wish I could tell her how special she made me feel. And that I understand completely but that I wish that we could still think about being together. I wish I could ask her to hold a place for me. I don't know why I want to. 

But I'm crushed with guilt. The guilt of liking someone too fast and caring deeply for them and having even the smallest of inside jokes and hugging them and cuddling. The guilt that I still want that tenfold and that they are dealing with something serious and bigger and that I can't help or that they could forget about me as an option for them. Guilt. Guilt. Guilt. I've cried a lot over the guilt that I know that I shouldn't feel this way and its overwhelming. I want to date this girl but I also know I should want her happiness more than that by a landslide. And I do want her to be happy, more than anything, but I also wish I could be happy with her. 

I can't think about anything else. So I asked her if she would be willing to date in the future. Because I would want to wait. I cannot for the life of me forget about someone who I felt so strongly for and I feel as though that is dumb but. I'm hoping to god she tells me to wait. To be the best friend until the time is right. Even if it hurts later, I still want that. And I don't know why.",actuallesbians,1578020886,Ryethomas008,,14,True,2020-01-02

6181,I (31/f) decided to let go of the relationship I had been holding on to too tightly and (yes) unhealthily,"Every time we had a fight in our turbulent 10 month relationship, she(33/f) would run away or block me, until the next day until I wouldnt stop calling her. She would say things like,"" I am not good for you, I am a cold person, I will never be good enough, I have always been abandoned ""(she has had a bad and a very hard childhood). I sympathize with her and I am (was) ready to work with her on being less avoidant and for me being less anxious. I thought I was in love, I had never felt this way before. Every time we 'talked' about the difficult stuff, she would take every word as an attack on herself and shut me out (after saying that she loved me but I deserved better). It had become that I would be the one asking for forgiveness for having expressed my needs/shortcomings (like I want emotional intimacy, I need you to give me time besides when you are feeling lonely or have nothing else to do, I want us to be able to talk more, I don't want us to push issues under the rug instead of talking about it, I want us to be vulnerable to each other to be able to connect, I want each of us to grow and be better human beings). I would have to actually make her imagine how she would feel if I had been the same way with her and she would agree she was wrong but then do the same again without realizing she was doing it. (later in the relationship, she called this me brainwashing her) I would always be the one asking to let us fix it and maybe she started taking me for granted. She once even told me to let her chase me and stop being so available for her.

Even when we started dating, she would tell me how two of her exes were still trying to contact her all the time even after being blocked. She had shared the letters they would sent to her (it said how she (my ex) had not given them a proper answer and just an ""i need time""; and how she should not punish herself for what has happened in her childhood).

She was still good friends with one of her exes (who was in an open relationship) when she started dating me and after we made it official, that friend got mad and she got really drunk and confessed that she had had feelings for her until recently but it wouldn't work.

She would get jealous of everyone I hung out with and tell me that she felt that because I was hanging out with 'smart' people I would leave them for her. I would reassure her by telling her she meant a lot for me and she was smart. I even had isolated myself a lot to make her feel better. She never reciprocated the same for me though. She always called me ridiculous for expressing how I felt when she would prioritize someone or something else over me. I always felt that she preferred having a lot of friends at one arm's length and no close vulnerable connection. Even if we went out alone, she would spend majority of the time trying to make new friends. I dont know how wrong or right I was in begging to make it work, to love me back, to let me in. I dont know if it was real love or just attachment. I know I need to work on myself and I need to be a better person for myself and for no one else. I just can't stop feeling like a bad person for 'abandoning' someone who has been abandoned at her most vulnerable (childhood) and not know what else to do. But I cant also be in line to be another one of her 'crazy exes'. I want to be a good person but I also want my needs fulfilled in a relationship. I am always ready to improve myself and change myself but I cant not hve any needs. I cant be a placeholder or a relationship status filler for someone to go on double dates or having house parties.

6207,|| Cuddles ||,"#01 

Today was another rainy gloomy winter Saturday, I had to pick up a girl from the airport. Our toddler was with me and our blob was with my wife. She wanted to join us for the lunch, if nothing happens, Like an unexpected clingy baby-mom nap.

Any way I picked that girl,  she saw our quietly sleeping toddler and said ""awww cute baby "" just as any other typical girl would have said. 
She asked ""Who is this baby"" Then we had that usual awkward silence for a minute, I had flying butterflies in my belly. But then I just replied ""Mine""

She stared at me with that look, I don't know how to define it but in mind I was like ""Oh here we go darling""  Surprisingly  I was okay with it. I think I'm more used to this and it's very beautiful as we accept it. 
So before she asks anything I said, ""Yes she is mine,  actually ours, She is 2 and she is adorable"" 
I looked at our daughter over my shoulder before starting the engine. She is the cutest.  

Our daughters .... our life. Nothing matters more than that. 

We have enough people in our life, who adore our blobs. That's handful, but enough.

6208,| Cuddles |,"#02

While we were on our way for the lunch.., my toddler decided not to sleep anymore but to ask - my attention. 
Yes, I know - our fault.  We raise them to be too clingy. But you tell me,,, what's the point of of raising little humans in to robots. 
We want them never to give up on the bond we share with them. I want them to follow the vows we shared... On the night my beautiful wife and I got married.. The ring she put on me still holds the warmth of that night wrapped around those beautiful promises....
""In sick and health , laughter and tears, Never to give up -  until the last breath... ""
I still remember every word, every minute of that night, whenever I see her finger with my glowing ring. 
I want our children to know what we went through to bring them to this beautiful happy home. Yes, that's why our blobs are too clingy and too soft..... 

So back to the story..

She was stretching her cute little arms, trying to open her sleepy tiny eyes, which reminds me how my wife always tease me saying
 ""Look they take this stretching thingy after you"" ..  

Well then,, my baby realized she was sleeping for a long time,  and has missed so many things and most of all she realized that she didn't get enough attention.

Then decided to cry so slowly... whispering something not clear, Cause we don't teach them to yell at us and scream... So our little daughter knew how to cry like a baby drama princess, because she knew that 
 I would stop the car for her... and yes of cause I did. 

""Okay, little Boo what's wrong"" I asked.

  I was looking at my cute girl, such an adorable blob. She looks exactly like my wife trust me. She has those big teary eyes, rolled down,  bottom lip, bubbly cheeks with pinky bush just like her mom, my wife.
 
Then,  at once...

 ""Cuddles"" She said. 

 Whattt..... !!!!! I was shocked.

 It was her first time, that she said the word Cuddles.. . 
I was speechless and my heart just dropped. Awww my baby.

I had to go to the back seat and rescue her from the seat belts and bring her to the front seat. I kept her on my lap, her tiny head with gorgeous hair.. Little pinky mouth facing my chest. I hugged her so much. She smells like milk. She smells like happiness. I hugged her so tightly and then she looked at me and giggled,

 "" You sneaky blob... Just want to cuddle on my chest. Just like your mom "" 

I said that aloud. Without realizing that I was not alone. 

Oops too late I guess.

6211,"Tonight, I had my ex-wife and her boyfriend around for dinner."," I don't really have a proper story to follow this up with, not really. I mean, there is one, but it's not interesting. The truth is, I just feel sorry for myself and wanted to share. 

Less than a year ago, my wife and I were in the midst of buying a house and making enthusiastic plans about children and life insurance and placemats.

Tonight? Tonight I made her boyfriend a fucking waffle bowl for dessert. I was a charming and gracious host. We drank. We played party games. He complimented my food, my book collection, my decor, and even my ass; he did the dishes without any sort of hesitation. He was a dream guest. 

It felt easy. We laughed a lot. We made oblique references to the somewhat unorthodox situation in which we find ourselves. We all had, I like to think, a good time. My ex-wife is - and I understand this is sadly common in the queer community - the only real family I have, and he is remarkably open to the idea that I will be, for better or worse, sticking around. I love him for that.

But believe me, I want to hate him. I want to hate him solely for the sheer satisfaction of hating the dude who has everything I ever wanted, and everything I worked for. But in truth, he's done nothing wrong. He seems to be a great guy. I like him as a human being, a lot. I hate that I like him.

They've left now. She did the thing that we've all done, where one person in a couple silently and effortlessly signals to the other that it's time to leave a social gathering. A friendly slap to other person's the upper thigh. I noted it. I had been dreading it all night. And then, suddenly, they were gone. My apartment echoes. 

They're now at their house. At my old house. By now, they'll be asleep in the bed that my ex-wife and I chose together. I feel like I've swallowed hot coals.",actuallesbians,1578052480,noaprincessofconkram,,40,True,2020-01-03

6215,Im flying up to see the girl who changed everything and I need to share,"Just under 4 months ago I (26yo) broke up with my long term bf turned fiancé after doing some travelling together and coming to the conclusion that I might be gay.. I always knew I was Bi but when I met this girl (26yo) who was travelling with us, she flipped my world upside down with the slightest hand on my thigh. 

We did some things I'm not proud of whilst still being in a relationship with my ex-partner and me and her were quite flirty and honestly a bit obsessed with each other. After 6 weeks of travelling together we said goodbye to each other never knowing if I would see her again.

It has now been over 5 months since I met her and in that time we have become really close friends. We talk every day, we send millions of snapchats everyday and about a month ago a told her I have feelings for her. She told me that she was confused about her feelings for me because its hard to understand your feelings for someone you only really know through texts and I 100% agreed with her but also told her that I still knew I feel something. She agreed that there was something she felt between us in the short time we spent together and she let me know that it was hard for her to see me then with my now ex-partner, which is totally understandable. We spoke about needing to see each other again but not knowing if/when we would get that opportunity.

Since telling her I have feelings she has very much upped the flirting from cheeky banter to nice, cute and caring. she's spoken about missing me and wanting to hang out together, that she smiles when I'm messaging her and that she's sad sometimes that I'm not around &lt;/3

Fast Forward to present day and I am flying to see her in 5 days... FIVE DAYS!  I hope we have the cutest run and collide airport hug :D

I am such a nervous ball of emotions! Of course I'm super excited to see her as its been months since we said a very emotional and intense goodbye. But... I can not stop thinking about the worst case scenario.

What if she doesn't have feelings like she thought she did? What if its different now because were not on holidays? what if she just liked the chase and that I was only exciting because I wasn't available? what if I'm not even her type?!! What if she was just trying to kiss me because she was drunk? WHAT HAPPENS IF SHE READS THIS AND THINKS IM A PSYCHO?! These are the questions on a constant loop in my head at the moment lol.

Obviously when I think about it rationally, it doesn't make sense that she would be flirting with me after I told her I had feelings if she didn't have some sort of feelings too but what if she doesn't want a relationship? What if she finds the distance too hard to manage? 

I have thought about her every FREAKING day since I met her and I don't know what I would do if I didn't have her to think about anymore.

6226,Girlfriend can't find my clit,"I hope this is the right place for this kind of post. I (f20) have been with my girlfriend (f23) for about 10 months now. We're long distance and could barely meet during the first months into our relationship. She is also the first person I've ever slept with and I'm the first girl she's ever been with. So I guess there's a lot of new things and a lot of things to learn for both of us.

It's really easy for my girlfriend to orgasm. She's pretty sensitive all over down there, and finding a spot, rhythm and technique that works for her isn't hard at all. I'm different from her. In order to orgasm or feel pleasure I need consistent direct or almost-direct clitoral stimulation. And the problem is that when she fingers me, she'll kinda drift away from my clit and go too ""far down"" if that makes any sense. Like, to the point where it's almost penetration but not really? . What happens because of this is that I barely get any clitoral stimulation when she touches me. I've tried to show her where my clit is with her hands and eyes, I've tried telling her to not go that far down, to go higher up etc, but she always loses the spot after just a few seconds. One time when I told her to not go so far down, she said something like ""it's kinda difficult to not go far down because your pussy (idk what other word to use) is small, smaller (like short I guess?) than mine"" lol. I don't even think that's true, what's funny is I even think I'm even a little bigger than her. And even if it were true, I can't imagine it'd be that hard to stay in the right spot...?

I do enjoy our sex a lot in different ways (it gets better every time we see each other) , but this is a problem that has started to bother me. The first few times we had sex I was like ""it's okay, no rush, she'll learn eventually"" but now that we've been with each other many times and things are not exactly getting better, I'm starting to worry a a little... I don't really know what else I can do to make her find and stay at my clit. Any advice?",actuallesbians,1578067203,Leading-Restaurant,,26,True,2020-01-03

6238,Trying to navigate what feels like the worst heartbreak in the world,"So back in May I made a post here about a good friend of mine who I was just completely and utterly falling for. A few days after posting that I got brave and we talked and she admitted to feeling the same way, just as strongly, and we got together.

Things escalated very, very quickly (that stereotype exists for a reason, but also we were already close prior to the relationship aspect). We were inseperable and by late September we were practically living together, had said we were in love with each other, had talked a bit about marriage down the line, etc. Serious stuff. I had never been happier in my entire life. This was it for me.

Without getting into details, she did a complete personality 180 at the end of October and completely cut me off. Ended not only the relationship, but the friendship as well, in a really cold way. Things had been perfect just the day before. I spent nearly two months trying to figure out if I had done something, what went wrong, if something had happened to her that she wasn't telling me about. I wasted so much energy and time worried about HER. A few weeks ago we ended up at the same event where I spotted her and her new boyfriend. So...that answers that. I basically ended up drunk on the sidewalk that night and a friend had to come pick me up.

I don't know how to adjust. I feel like a huge chunk of my life is just empty now. She was my ""person"" and I feel lost now, and feel like I'll never have closure as to why she would make huge commitments like that to me if she never meant them. I miss her so badly that it physically hurts all the time, and I hate that the person that I loved and who I'm longing for might not even be in there anymore. We both also run in the same circles/work in the same industry and I'm forced to constantly watch her move on with her life as if I've just been erased from it. It all just fucking SUCKS.

I don't know what the point of getting this all out here was, but whenever I'm on reddit I see that first post I made about her in my post history and it makes me want to break down. I don't know what happened. And I miss her. Heartbreak is such a bitch.",actuallesbians,1578073177,paperjenna,,7,True,2020-01-03

6242,I just feel really gross today [trigger warning] [rape],"I posted to r/twoxchromosomes about my rape I also centered about the police in my post I got down voted surprisingly fast then some dude PMs me to ""just post to gonewild already"". Im bi but I've always felt safe in this sub and need to vent. This was my post:

&gt;When I was 14 I went to a bon fire with Torry and Krystal, my best friends. They had somehow got ahold of some vodka and cigarettes. I had some weed. We arrived pretty late, like, after 11.

&gt;I pretty much kept to myself the whole time. I only really wanted to talk to Torry. As the night went on we got more drunk and high. We started loosing layers of clothes and at one point Torry sat in my lap. I was in heaven. Her boobs were in my face, she kissed me several times and we just kept laughing about nothing.

&gt;Torry is bigger than me and eventually she had to get up because we were too hot and she was crushing my legs. I stumbled off to get water and bumped into Kyle.

&gt;His name really is Kyle and yes, he's really ""a Kyle."" I don't think ""being a Kyle"" was a thing yet but if it was, he was fucking living it. He was loud and obnoxious and cursed like a sailor.

&gt;But he I'm being honest he was really hot. He was older than me, lots of muscles and really blue eyes. It's selfish but, I was frustrated that Torry and Krystal weren't paying attention to me so I was excited that an older, very attractive boy was.

&gt;We flirted a little but then he tried to take my shirt off after I said I was hot. He said just wearing a bra was like wearing a swim suit. Problem was, I had no boobs so, I wasn't wearing one. When he said ""that's fine"" I got a feeling I was in trouble.

&gt;I didn't want to offend him. He was bigger than me by a lot and everything he did always had this weird tension. I was torn between the fact that a hot guy was paying attention to me and the fact I was scared of him.

&gt;I don't remember how things progressed but I remember at one point he had his mouth on my chest and then between my legs. I remember shaking and grabbing his hair because I just wanted it to stop. I moved as little as possible. I woke up later fully clothed and found Torry.

&gt;I don't remember the details of the next few days but I know Krystal somehow figured out what happened and told my parents. We went to the hospital and I got checked out. I had cervical bruising, a sprained wrist and some other bruises and cut from being outside all night.

&gt;I didn't know but apparently Kyle was known to the older girls for being a creep and a jerk. BUT His uncle was on the school board, his parents were on City council and the family owned basically everything in town.

&gt;I know the police officer who first showed up was friends with Kyle's dad. He was a city cop who I've seen at games and school stuff. I knew nothing about rape culture at the time but, looking back, he hit all the ""I'm a shit cop"" checkboxes. ""What were you wearing? That's it?"" ""Regret isn't the same as rape,"" ""I wanna get this right because he'll be kicked off the football team,"" ""are you sure it was him?""

&gt;My Dad eventually exploded on him. My Dad threatened to ""go back to jail over this"" so my Dr kicked them both out.

I'm leaving out the rest because it's just me ranting about police and the way rape victims are treated. I'm just not able to deal with the comments related to that stuff today.

Since this story happened I've been sexually assaulted 4 times and stalle, aggressively, once.

I'm just kind of over men right now. I *thought* I had made a really good male friend. He was nice, treated me well and with respect. We were friends. Then, out of no where *ghosted*

6244,Is this attraction?,"Hola gals!  Heads up, this is a question about being with men.

How on earth do you tell the difference between genuine Kinsey 5 attraction and enjoying sex with men because you’re horny or suffering from compulsory heterosexuality?

I’ve long known that I’m sexually attracted to women’s bodies and not to men’s.  However, I’ve had several crushes on men and have felt desire to have sex with them.  I don’t know where the desire comes from though, since the male form does nothing for me.  Touching them doesn’t arouse me, and neither does just looking at them.  However, there have absolutely been times that I have found myself wanting to have sex with them and having fun doing so.  Relationships don’t last, though, since there’s no genuine attraction.

I don’t want to delude myself or continue participating in compulsory heterosexuality, if that’s what this is.  I see lesbians all over the place (especially on r/latebloomerlesbians) talking about how they’ve enjoyed sex with men and even sometimes sought it out.  Surely that’s where I fall, right?  I imagine I’m not bisexual, since a bi woman has sexual attraction to men’s bodies, right?

I have been questioning my sexuality for years. I’m 25 now and feel sort of silly that I haven’t explored sooner but have been in relationships/ very hetero social circles so haven’t taken enough time to self reflect. 

I have been interested in women, had crushes and even had a few sexual experiences. I am super interested in romantic relationships women but extremely nervous to act on it. 

I don’t want to come off as trying to use anyone to explore my own sexuality. I also am nervous that no one would want to “teach” me the ways.

It’s time for the classic masc-presenting trans lady game show, “Did That Old White Woman Glare at Me Because I’m a Dyke or Because She Clocked Me,” with your host, me. On this episode: “Will y’all allow me to walk my dog?”

First up on our show today, the old woman in sunglasses and the nice clothes from a decade gone by! You used your whole face to express your disapproval and frank disgust, and I picked it up loud and clear through those spherical shades! Were you perhaps threatened by beanie, leather jacket, and ripped-knee pants? Was it the confidence in how I carried myself in androgyny? Perhaps it was the clash your perspective drew between my long hair and strong facial features.  Whatever the case, you win the “okay, boomer” award for making it clear to me that I’m doing something right. Conglaturation for all you’re doing for the queer community!

Next up, we have a pinched-face woman in sweats—I unironically hope my hair looks as nice as yours in my old age! You flicked your gaze at me rapidly like I was a Boo in Super Mario and would chase you if you looked away. You could have made your discomfort at my presence a little more clear if you moved to the other side of the trail, but I recognize the constraints of “public decency and politeness” on your performance and award you a respectable 7.8 out of 10. I’m just walking my dog, lady, I’m a normal-ass person like everyone else (yes, even though I’m not cis) and the skittish border collie plastered to my leg literally could not be a worse attack dog.

Finally, we have the large, tough-looking woman with her graying hair in that classic butch cut that looks like an un-crested wave (y’all know what I’m talking about). You only glanced at me for an extra second, and your face didn’t change much, but the brief, stoic upturn of your lips reassured me that I was and could be seen as I am and as a real human person navigating this world with everybody else. Perhaps I was reading the meaning I wanted to see into that exchange, and perhaps it wasn’t an exchange at all, but to me it was meaningful and important and I thank you for being.

6294,What should I do. I feel like I’ve tried everything,"Hey so I have a very long complicated situation. So pretty much what’s going on was fall of 2018 at my old job I met someone who I really liked. Keep in mind she’s the first row who I’ve ever had obvious feelings for. At the moment I’m 22 never really been in a real relationship so obviously I’m really shy and very conscious about the move that I make. Sometimes I feel like I was too shy to really make a move just because I didn’t feel like timing was right. The girl that I like is very much confused with her sexuality I won’t bring up anything  that is personal to her but there are times where it will affect her immensely. Other way at one point we were talking up until February 2019 that’s why she decided to cut things off because she had no idea if she was comfortable with sleeping with the woman which would’ve been me. Ever since it seems like she really kept to herself about that kind of stuff I don’t think she’s been in a relationship she always post that she is single and there’s lots of situations where I was still giving mixed signals after-the-fact. You see she have decided to stay friends with me. Apparently the friendship means a lot to her but I have had lots of moments between February till today of me going back and forth as far as not knowing whether or not I wanted to stay close or before only because I obviously still have feelings and as far as I know, she doesn’t want a relationship with me. And the thing is I don’t want a relationship if she’s not ready if that was the case because quite frankly I probably still have a lot more to learn about myself but at the end of the day I still have feelings that I cannot get rid of. It would almost be a year since we’ve caught it off but it’s still very much hard for me. I have cut her off multiple times to focus on myself and still feel no difference as far as emotional attraction towards her. Yes obviously I know that I should let it go but there’s a lot to it that leaves me confused. Like for example In July I decided to call off Our friendship so I can focus on myself eventually came back after a month and she mentioned something about going to Disneyland together with one of my friends who is currently in in a relationship. Another time i posted that I got a new phone (October) and she commented and FaceTime me for about an hour in between that FaceTime call she posted something on Snapchat about being alone for the holidays and needing like a cuddle buddy. She generally cares about me because she’s always concerned about my health and my financial position and making sure that I’m not doing things that are detrimental to me overall and that something that really stands out with her. We spoke about traveling we spoke about adopting pets and quite frankly we have a lot in common but now it’s a bit weird. At this point I have no idea if I’m dealing with someone who is trying to come to terms with their sexuality but an idea that I’m thinking of doing is possibly sending out a letter explaining how I feel still and if she is questioning her sexuality that I would be happy to be her friend and help her through that if that is the case because either way I’m not looking for an immediate relationship but I really enjoy our friendship and I hate how awkward things have gotten in although I do have feelings for her to be honest I would rather still stick by her side and help her out if that is the case Because I feel very unfulfilled with her not in my life. Since February I have been working on myself a lot and I’m completely in a different more positive place mentally and physically but she is the one thing that I cannot change. I have tried many dates with different people and yet she’s always the first and only thing on my mind. Either way there is still a lot more to it and the reason why I am on here is because I don’t really have any real advice that could be given",actuallesbians,1578105339,rocketkidd7,,3,True,2020-01-03

6301,"Asexual, needing advice or help (Questioning romantic attraction)","   (This is quite long, feel free to skim if you'd like! &lt;3)

&amp;#x200B;

   Hello! I am undoubtedly an asexual and have gladly labeled myself as such for quite sometime. I am now bothered by my lack of understanding towards whom I'm romantically attracted towards. Now, recently, I've come across the possibility I might be Bi, Lesbian, or pan- in a romantic sense. Now, you can skip the next paragraph if you wish, as it is just background information. 

Now, I grew up in a very strict and slightly dysfunctional household. I grew with trust and affection problems as well as several, later, diagnosed disorders. I was always scolded and yelled at for any imperfection. Yet, I so strongly urged for a romantic relationship. I believe that might've been because of the idealization in books and the idea that I could be loved by an individual (which, I haven't had or felt in my environment). All my future relationships were undoubtedly bad or terrible. Not once did I even consider the idea I could date someone of the same sex. Personally, I found myself strongly against it- just like my family had been or people around me had been. I wanted to be accepted and never truly thought for myself. It wasn't until much later in life, 17 years of age did I come to accept my own Asexual views. I never had that sexual attraction towards anyone and I had two relationships that failed because of my lack of attraction towards them. My love and my efforts were never enough and I never understood or enjoyed the idea of sexual interaction or attraction. 

   Now, I find myself accepting and actually encouraging such ideas in this community as a whole. The rare exclusion I find towards certain groups does scare me but I really do appreciate the kindness found here. I just hope I can also feel as accepted for whom I am as some are. Now, I still find myself fearing I might actually have romantic attraction towards other females. I was never friends or even close friends with other females (excluding one person) and always hung around males. I found they were easier to talk too. Two years back, when exploring who I was as an individual and accepting I might be ace, I found a wonderful girl. I found myself actually wanting to call her my friend and yearning to become closer but, I never once wanted to think I might want to date her. I just found myself more flustered around her and put my best effort to talk to her. When I became distant and stopped talking to her, I still find myself looking back and wondering if I might've actually.. Wanted more. 

   I fear the idea. Sometimes, I think it might be the truth but I fear I might be wrong and I fear the change- especially when I know if I did try such a thing, I would have to keep it a secret from my family. But, now talking about males. I've always tried dating them, they were easy to get along with and if they asked my out- I just would say yes. It always ended in such harmful and unhealthy ways, yet I still always got what first came to me. Now, when I look back, I feel like most my feelings were forced and less understood. I just wanted it- thinking that it was right and that they might love me like I tried for them. Still, I find myself much more open to the idea of being with them and when fantasizing cuddling or sleeping beside one other- I mostly think of a male. I find it mildly comforting. But, with neither, I don't think of the idea of kissing or farther. I'm much more closed off physically nowadays and I'm worried I might never be able who I really do want. 

   Somewhat, I don't care for the sex, gender, or otherwise. I find some aesthetic attraction but otherwise, I care most about their personality. Other than the fear and the distrust, I feel like I'd accept anyone. 

   I'm sorry about the lengthy explanations but, I felt they might be necessary to see if I am forcing an idea or if the past is warping my judgement or rightful emotion. I truly appreciate you reading though, I hope it wasn't too much of a bother. Thank you. 

   So, I'd like to ask you if you have any advice on what I should do, what you might think (opinion), or if I should just ignore it and keep the questioning to myself?",actuallesbians,1578109544,AstrialNova,,0,True,2020-01-03

6305,Questioning sexuality (crosspost from r/nonbinarylesbians,"Questioning sexuality

I’m interested in hearing more about people’s (especially non-binary people’s - though any and all are appreciated) experiences with compulsory heterosexuality - or generally how you knew or figured out whether or not you were really attracted to men. I’ve seen some large posts about comp het in general (usually as it pertains to cis lesbians), but I’d like to know some more stories, as I am trying to figure myself out. 

TLDR: 26 nonbinary afab isn’t sure if they like guys despite their longest relationships being with guys. Am I just super in love with this fem person or am I really gay as hell? 

For background, I’m 26, nonbinary/genderqueer (afab, if it matters). I have only let myself think about my gender over the past 3 years or so. I didn’t let myself really think about my own sexuality until I was 20 or so. (Sorry ahead of time for the wall of text. I’m not sure how to stfu and i don’t even feel like this is the whole story) 

I originally came out as panromantic demisexual and was in a long term (dating since freshman year of high school) relationship with a cis het guy. I know I definitely get a lot of obligation in that relationship and I assumed that it was more about the length of time we were together (“well we’ve been together this long - I guess I’m just meant to suffer” - 2014 me). Especially before coming out, I did a lot of repressing and dealt with dissociation a lot. I still struggle having to unlearn automatic repression/invalidation of my emotions but it was way worse then. 

Near the end of our relationship, I realized the strong feelings is been suppressing about my best friend (nonbinary transfeminine) and started dating her. It was beyond anything I’d imagined. Touching her felt like electricity and her lips were so soft - kissing felt natural. Everything about her was attractive. With my previous partner, I had a mental connection, so I wanted to have a physical connection and to do that, I focused on certain details (hair, collar bone, that sort of thing). But with her, it’s just like everything is just so completely her that even things that I might not find attractive on someone I didn’t know were just these beautiful details that added to everything she is. There isn’t any sort of doubt that every sort of attraction was there. I understood for the first time that the songs people sang about love weren’t exaggerating. I unironically wrote love poetry because I felt like I couldn’t keep these feelings inside - it was just pouring out. Unfortunately, due to distance and poor communication on my part (as well as processing trauma and being afraid of turning into an awful person and hurting her somehow), I broke up with her. We only dated for 6 months or so, but I’d had repressed feelings about her for over a year before then - and continue to have feelings for her years later. So I don’t think it was just infatuation. 

After we broke up, I started seeing one of my guy friends. We had a bond for sure going in. And the sex that we had was really good (pleasurable but also he was sensitive to my dissociation and things like that). We bonded further over having similar traumas and he made me feel safe. For several months, I said that I wasn’t sure what label to put on us bc I didn’t understand my feelings. I really cared about him but it wasn’t necessarily romantic. And the attraction or pull that brought me to him sexually wasn’t physical attraction. In fact, I had to ignore certain masculine things sometimes to have sex (which is also something that happened a lot with my ex-bf). During all of this, I wondered if maybe I was on the aromantic spectrum or felt more ace and/or aro towards guys or if that was a thing at all. 

But he had a lot of feelings for me. I had feelings for him certainly but I knew they weren’t the same. Even so, I went into a relationship, overlooked my own discomfort bc it made sense to stay with him. I even initiated us moving in together bc it just made sense logically. 

Fast forward two years to now. We just went on a break for a lot of reasons*, but one of them was because I can’t stop questioning my sexuality. I thought about it a lot this summer and tried to ignore it but I know it isn’t healthy to ignore. So I’m really wanting to look at a variety of people’s experiences figuring out their sexuality. A lot of info out there is more about “how do I know if I like [binary gender you are expected to NOT be attracted to]” but not “how do I know that I’m not attracted to [binary gender I’m expected to be attracted to]”. Seeing it from a non-binary perspective would be nice bc it’s hard to find and honestly dysphoria does complicate figuring out some of it. 

With all of this, I am still hopelessly (sort of desperately and maybe a bit sadly) in love with the girl I dated. We’re still very close but can’t date. I’m not sure if my feelings are just bc I love her more than anyone else or if I actually don’t like guys the way I “am supposed to”. 

(*relevant detail: one reason was that it feels like he isn’t super into the relationship since we moved out. Despite the fact that he hasn’t put in effort and that I am the one questioning my feelings, I have still been putting in a ton of work. I’m not even sure why other than I care about him. I love him but I know it’s not what it’s supposed to be [though what does that even mean?]. )

6306,had success finding something serious through online dating? what’s your story?,"i know that people have success with this, but after too many years of trying to form a meaningful connection with someone on apps i’m starting to feel like maybe there’s a problem with my approach. i’m curious to learn from stories of what worked for y’all

for me, trying to meet a partner on a dating app has started to feel like a joke. i go through this cycle of meet girl, get excited about girl, sort of nebulously date girl for 2-3 months because they are afraid of commitment, get ghosted by girl or gaslighted into thinking i was imagining there was any connection at all. repeat. no matter how physically or emotionally we seem to connect it all seems to end up the same way. 

i’m super explicit on my profile: i’m looking for someone to, eventually, become my long-term partner and settle down and have children with, aka not casual. i know this doesn’t happen overnight and that it will take time to feel like it’s right. i’m not looking for an immediate commitment (i’ve done that stereotype a few times, and it has never ended well), but i feel like after 5+ years of looking i should have at least encountered something that got a little serious even if it didn’t work out?

it’s gotten to the point where my friends have started to say i’m cursed, they don’t understand how i always find such fickle women afraid of any kind of commitment. maybe this is just the nature of dating in a big city (sf bay area), lesbian dating in general, or dating in your late 20s? but i’m really starting to get disheartened and could use some of your inspiring tales to renew my hope!",actuallesbians,1578111906,autumnnora,,8,True,2020-01-03

6316,toxic lesbian relationship,"I was in a relationship with this girl that i met in high school for about 3 years. She was my first EVERYTHING. Which is why it’s been so hard to live a life without her. We broke up about 3 days ago and i’ve never been SO relieved about breaking up with someone. We have broken up many times previously before, but have always gotten back together. This time i’m really going to try to get over her and never go back to her ever again. 

The first year of our relationship was wonderful. We spent every day together and everything was great. And the whole thing went downhill after i had came out to my family and they stopped me from seeing her. Us having to sneak around all the time definitely put a strain on our relationship but we believed it was worth it. (at the time it was). She started getting tired of all the sneaking around because we would still have to sneak around. She started being really mean to my family, especially my older sister. She began to think it was Ok to talk really bad about my mom and sister, which now i really regret letting her get away with because she mad me distance myself from my family. She hated when I would spend time with my family and would laugh at the fact. She made me distance myself from all of my friends, would get mad if i hung out with anyone else, would get mad at me if i dressed too cute so I would dress in big hoodies and sweats/leggings all of the time. Blamed me for all of her problems, and would repeatedly tell me that i’m the reason why she’s ruined and has depression/anxiety. She was also a BIG time user with drugs like alcohol, weed, and nicotine. Alcohol was the worst one because she would actually try to get physical with me, and if i would try to hit back she would leave me at her place for HOURS and wouldn’t tell me where she would go. She would even get extremely mad at me for not texting her goodmorning before she woke up, or if i didn’t call her beautiful, or use emojis in text messages that i sent her. Very immature. Very self conscious spirit she had. Something i will never forget is when she would shame my race. I am mixed with black &amp; When I would say that I have black in me to others/claim that I am African American she would tell me that i’m not black or that “i’m not like those ghetto black girls” She is white btw.

This woman has definitely scarred me and I will never be the same! But definitely in a good way because now I know the red flags of a toxic relationship. I’ll never put myself through that again. Don’t ever settle and accept toxicity because you feel that it’s all you have. Always put yourself first.

6318,I know this is kinda cliche but there's this cute girl at Starbucks...😣,"I work at a restaurant that has a Starbucks in the same plaza. My coworkers go there quite often and I've never really been into Starbucks but I go there every once in a while. There is this really cute girl that works there and I cannot tell if she is into me or not. 

Like I said, I'm not really into Starbucks that much so I don't go there as often as my coworkers do. 

She took my order ONCE and she memorized my name. She even spells it right and everything, every time (it’s not a common name at all). The other starbucks employees there never remember my name, I have to remind them every time. Whenever I'm in there waiting for my drink to be made I can feel her staring at me. Although I'm too afraid to look at her at the same time. 

She always asks me about my day and how work has been. She's always super nice to me but when I start asking her about HER she gets kinda awkward and quiet and I cannot figure out if its because she's shy and reserved or because she senses my super gay energy and doesn't like it. 

My gaydar completely sucks.

I identify as straight but recently began to accept I'm a bit bi.  My best friend is more certain that she is bi, and we have often randomly kissed. At the end of last year we got really drunk and had sex. I was upset that I wasn't able to fully understand or remember it because of being drunk. We joked about doing it again to ""test"" if I liked it, then we actually did.. like 10 times during November/December.

We do enjoy it but we always agree to just be friends and often say to eachother that we want boyfriends and are really horny for guys.

Last weekend I was just cuddling with her in bed and I seriously started to feel like I was in love with her in a way I have never felt about anyone. I didn't say anything because I was still trying to be straight and didn't want to complicate our friendship (even though having sex like every week for 2 months already complicated it quite a lot lol).

Anyway I just tried to continue my life, now she has gone on dates with a boy, and I'm happy for her and hope it goes well but also I'm in bed crying and trying to imagine that she is with me because I just want her right now.

I’m 22 and she is older I was expecting some more mature behavior.

6338,Should I ignore her?,"I'll TRY to keep it short. 

Basically me and this girl were talking for a year, fooled around a bit and she developed some feelings. I didn't want to pursue it because she was just out of a relationship (was still kind of in one, but ending it) she was an emotional wreck because of her abusive relationship so there were qualities /behaviours I observed in her that were less than desirable. I didn't quite feel the same way about her. But I was very fond of her. She is suuuuper hot, smart and kind.
I was still there when she needed me. And she relied heavily on me for emotional support. We remained friends but I backed off ALOT, as to not lead her on and add to any stress she was already under. Talking daily went to talking approx once a fortnight. 

She would send snaps to me daily, mostly of herself. I ignored them until she got the idea which took longer than you'd expect. Lol. I did this because she was still healing and I was not wanting to be in the middle of it all. Despite how fond I was of her, it seemed like the most obvious choice for me and for her.

Anyway, she got into another relationship almost straight after getting out of one. There was about 12 weeks (3 months) of her being single. 
So, as she got better and became more healthy within herself I allowed dialogue to open up more freely between us. I recently started developing a ""crush"" on her, I suppose. She's in a relationship so I would never pursue anything or over step the mark. My issue is, I like her. I think about her all the time. We speak fortnightly, she usually intiates communication and it's rather superficial. She asks me advice on business stuff. I keep her updated on what I'm doing etc but that's about it. So basically, now that I'm crushing on her I really hate how she pops up into my world over and over again, it's kind of a cruel reminder of what i can't have. It's not like we have the same depth in our convos the way we used to. It's rather surface level stuff so my question is...would it be totally terrible to slowly ignore her until she's completely phased out? Or is that cruel?

P.s there isn't a chance in hell I'll tell her how I feel. It's a futile pursuit.

He’s cishet but he’s incredibly feminine, and I’ve recently been masturbating to him and fantasising about him (nsfw) &gt;! anally fingering me and fisting my pussy !&lt; . Thing is, I’ve still got a lust for girls and no lust for boys and this is only just for him and just for these actions.

6351,Got a strong feeling that my friend might be bi or gay and idk what do with it,"I’m a lesbian myself and came out a few months ago. My friend (let’s call her L) was super supportive when I came out. We’re both 18 btw. 

She retweets and likes a lot of lesbian content on twitter, she always refer to a future ‘partner’ , just hasn’t a super ‘hetero’ style (as far as you can define someone’s sexuality by that) and watches all shows with lesbian or bi characters in it (for example, she is a huge fan of Casey and izzie in atypical, but also loves the show wynonna Earp and says that show has a super great (wlw) ship). 

Now the following occurred:
I’m on tinder to chat with other girls and perhaps meet someone and L just sent me screenshot that she found me on tinder. She was super cool about it and was saying that my photos were awesome and stuff (I used some fun meme-like photos of myself). I asked her what she was doing on tinder and she answered that she was doing it with a friend for fun yesterday but couldn’t delete it because she liked it. Well, because she could find me on tinder, she had her search thing on women. I also found her btw after she sent that screenshot and she just used her own photos and made a serious account for it and is still searching for women.

Well, because of this I got a strong feeling she might be (also) into women. 
I don’t know if I should say something about it, because I know it isn’t my place to out her or make her out herself and I also don’t want it to seem like I’m trying to hit on her (because I’m not).
On the other hand I want her to know that she could come out to me if she wants to and that it’s perfectly fine to be gay or bi. I of course won’t say anything about it with other people around. If I’d say anything it would be over text or when we are just with the two of us. Just want her to know that it would be totally okay (but maybe she already knows that I would be okay with it cause I’m gay myself).

6356,"Broken up with, advice needed","Hey everyone, this might be a more relationship question however I am a lesbian so I figured I’d post here first. 

My girlfriend and I (now non girlfriend...I dont want to refer to her as my ex, because I find that, that should be used on bad breakups) split up, she wanted to. We had been together for almost a year and a half with me being 22 and her being 19. Things were great within the relationship, I couldnt have asked for better. 
She is bi and although she has done things with girls and seen other girls, I was her first official same sex relationship. 

She had ended things because her mind was a jumble and she was unsure of what she wanted. (She is in her first year of uni and just finished exams so that could be a possibility of her jumbled mind?) She had also told her one side of the family about her sexuality and I guess about me- which was not taken well- however her other half of the family is fine with it. 

Besides the fact of some of the family not taking it well and her not knowing what she wanted, she still loves me and told me this was one of the hardest decisions of her life, telling me she had, had multiple breakdowns before she ended things with me. 

When we were holding each-other she had told me, “Theres a cheesy saying, you throw something away and if it comes back its yours”. When i looked back at it, its like she wants me but needs time. Hell, we both talked to each-other about a future and it seemed to be in our favourite, some of her friends and family (some family members without meeting me) thought I was the one for her. I know we briefly planned that in her last year of uni, we may move in together. (I’d probably pop the question at anytime after that tbh.)

When I left after the breakup, I had this feeling, maybe its a gut feeling maybe its hope or false hope, I dunno. But apart of me thinks it isnt over. 

We both would like to be in our lives but obviously need time for healing. We both know that if we need anything we can contact one another.

I have never in my life expressed an interest in men to my straight friends (but also have been careful to not inadvertently come out to them). When they show me men they like, and ask if they're cute or something, I try my best to give a vague response because I am 1) incapable of being dishonest and don't want to hurt their feelings and 2) not interested in bringing up my sexuality and having to deal with whatever happens after that. It's like, I don't know if they're cute or not. 

I know that they are probably fine people and wouldn't judge me if I came out (maybe! you never know until it happens!) but I feel that it's none of their business and I don't feel like making a big deal out of it or answering questions/having my identity dissected etc.

I also know that they're joking, but it gets old really fast. All of my friends are adults. I could see if we were in high school or middle school, but these kind of ""ooh who are you texting? your hot boyfriend you keep hiding from us? why are you smiling so hard at your phone, he must be gorgeous!"" feel so juvenile to me lol And in most cases, I'm actually laughing at something one of my queer and/or trans friends said bc they're THEE funniest people I know.

Anyways, I wish we could leave these kinds of jokes back in middle school. Worst part is that sometimes people who aren't in on the joke will hear and believe them, and then I have to explain to them that my ""boyfriend"" doesn't exist! I think I am more sensitive to these types of jokes because I'm a lesbian and pretty much grew up being constantly invalidated. No amount of ""I do not like boys/men"" has made my mom stop insinuating that I could possibly get a boyfriend/husband at some point.

6377,Advice please?,"Hi, I'm sorry if I'm not posting this in the right place, I'm new to reddit but I'm hoping someone may be able to give some advice. 

My gf and I have been together for nearly 2.5 years after meeting when we were 18/19. we have a healthy and mature relationship and we're open and honest about everything. 

We waited a while after becoming a couple before we starting getting intimate together as that was what we both preferred, I was more anxious about having sex with her as she is slightly older and I thought she might be more experienced than I was at the time (I'd only just recently come out and I'd previously only been with boys before).

We laugh about it now because we're comfortable and communicate more now, but initially our sex life was a bit disappointing for the both of us. I don't think either of us came in the first few months of being together. Obviously as time has gone on we've learned more about each other's bodies and become more comfortable together, and I love making her cum and having sex with her. She also makes me cum but half of time I just don't (nonetheless I still love it).

I've been honest with her about how I feel, and we've tried loads of things to try and get me there. It makes me feel awful because I don't want her to feel like I don't enjoy having sex with her, or to feel that I'm not attracted/don't love her anymore (she's told me she worries that may be the case). This isn't her fault, but I don't know why this is happening. 

Its beginning to take a toll on our relationship because she feels guilty for not getting me there and I feel guilty because I don't want her to feel like that. 

I'm wondering if anyone had any ideas of what the matter is? We have sex frequently and we both have high libido. We both masturbate but not very frequently because most of the time we're together.

Thank you :)",actuallesbians,1578168624,boptitch12,,4,True,2020-01-04

She then stated that she preferred flat girls (my boobs basically don’t exist). Later on she said “sidenote, demonchild’s hair looks great and I’m jealous” (I had cut my hair myself and gave myself a bob, when I first showed her she said I looked really good, it sounded reallyyyy gay). I’m worried that this is wishful thinking. There have been plenty of other gay moments between us but I’m still not sure.

Korea, which means there is a friendly neighbor right above us that threaten to nukey nukey us now and then. (Korea is in a truce w. N. Korea, the war is not over yet, just stopped.) 
So we’re a country of conscription(forced draft) of a male aged 23-27 or so. And here’s a problem; our country is deadass homophobic. So they ‘ban’ homosexuality in a military, no DADT, no nothing, just ‘banned’ it. You gay, you go to jail. So gay guys must hide their sexuality and never leave the closet while they are in a obligated service, however there are a movement in a military to search who is homosexual and make them go to a jail/publicly humiliate them. There was a case that a military officer traced down one guy’s personal life and proved he’s gay - and  that guy went to jail. 
This is not only a gay guy’s problem - in 2010, an lesbian lieutenant was sexually assaulted and raped just because she’s a lesbian, and the court call it not guily of a crime, not enough proof they said. So many lesbians, just like gays, have to live in closet forever to be safe in this homophobic environment. So I don’t know what’s happening to a LGBTQ+ community in a service in other countries, and why my post is labeled as controversy, but this is what’s happening here. That’s why they sell rainbow dogtag for gay rights in military and the movement to change those horrible culture is ongoing.

I am just unable of connecting with them emotionally and I can't relate with them because of my feminist views and the misogynistic views of (most) men. I have no desire to be in a relationship with a man and I never find myself crushing on men. HOWEVER, I fantasize about men sexually all of the time.

6419,So... turns out my gf is into fisting and I have questions,"So toward the end of last year I started seeing this woman. She's my first girlfriend and I'm very happy with our relationship thus far. About a month ago we were having a night in and she knows I'm rather inexperienced. She's asked me in the past to show her videos I've seen of things I'd like to try, find hot, etc. So she just said, ""I don't want you to get freaked out, but do you want to see what I'm really into?"" I said sure and she proceeded to show me fisting videos. First this does nothing for me. I don't get the appeal of it, but I'm not judging. I love her and I want to make her happy so I watched. However, the shocking twist was she doesn't like to be fisted she likes to be the fister because it's a whole power/domme thing. Oh boy.

Naturally I'm a bit scared and hesitant. For starters until I started becoming intimate with her I never had anything bigger than a single finger inside me. She's now used toys with me and in an attempt to 'train' me has been using more fingers. I can now manage three but don't like it. However, I love her and want her to be happy. I just have a bunch of questions.

So basically I'm not sure how direct I should be but her are my questions/concerns.

1. Does it actually feel good?

2. Can this seriously damage me?

3. As I said I'm still rather young and green, will this have any long lasting effects? I know that things down there bounce back but what about in terms of sensation and stuff like that.

4. Other than slowly trying with bigger things, if there anything I can do to prepare?

5. How as the receiver do I make things enjoyable for her? She explained it's a power and control type thing, but do I just lay there and take it?

So you can tackle those questions or if you can just provide me with an overview or to somewhere that talks about this and health and safety around it, I would greatly appreciate it.

Edit: So basically everybody seems to be telling me that I shouldn’t go forward which is a bit relieving and sad at the same time. I am meeting her this afternoon and will have a serious talk to her about it. Thank you all for your advice and support.

6427,A Few Bad Apples Really do Ruin the Bunch,"Recently, some of the people in my friend group started hanging out with us more often. Normally, this wouldn't bother me, but these two specific people are the most irritating 'friends' I've ever had the displeasure of hanging out with. They're part of that awful group of (straight) teenagers that think being casually homophobic is something that should be constantly joked about. Every conversation I have with the two of them is full of their 'jokes' about me being a disappointment to my family for being gay and the two of them calling each other and anything that moves the f-slur.

What's worse is that me and my girlfriend seem to be the only of the five-ish LGBT+ kids in our group bothered by it! The rest seem content in letting the blatant homophobia slide. Of course, only one of the many, many, straight kids (I go to a relatively small Catholic school, which means there's plenty of them) in our group has said anything negative about the two girls' behavior. 

If I do or say anything that makes it seem like I'm uncomfortable with the constant use of slurs and distasteful jokes, they act like I'M the bad guy for being too sensitive. It really sucks, but I don't know how to get away from the two at all because cutting them off would inevitably also mean cutting most, if not all, of my friend group off because of how often they interact with each other.

Anyways, I just had to get that off my chest, if you've stuck around reading this long and have any advice on how to distance myself from them, it would be greatly appreciated.",actuallesbians,1578192366,wlwjigsaw,baby lesbian,9,True,2020-01-04
6428,I am having such a hard time.,"I've had a month off in between semesters, and the whole time I struggled with my sexuality. 5 years ago I thought I was ace and I denied it. Then my friend came out as bi 2 years ago, and I outed myself to her and I instantly regretted it. I think girls are attractive, but I've never had an official crush on one. 

I made a post on r/bisexual and they said I sound asexual. And it made a lot of sense to me, because with boys I have dated, I feel so repulsed by them. I almost vomited because I thought a boy had a boner. Even basic romantic shit felt empty as hell. I still think some boys are attractive, though, so that's why I thought I was bi. Then I thought I was asexual, and I was unsure of my romantic attraction. 

But then I thought that maybe I am so repulsed by men, so maybe I just like women? I don't mind lesbian porn. Some straight porn is just fucking nasty. But idk it's like lots of straight women like lesbian porn, and I reasoned that women are always more attractive than men. However, I usually like butch women, so I said I must be straight because butch women ""are like men."" But that's dumb as fuck and not true.

Also I dress stereotypically gay. I watched a video on things gay people own and I owned most of it. I was one of those people who was a tomboy with lots of guy friends. I used to flirt with all the guys, and then when they wanted commitment, I didn't go through on it. One guy I liked for 10 years, and when he went to ask me out I ignored him. Once I enter into a relationship, I sabotage it over stupid shit. I was 13 when I had my first bf, and I thought I didn't want sex because of my age. Now I'm 18 and I still don't want it. Idk if it was a woman, would it be different? 

I asked my bi friend about it, and she was convinced that I'm a lesbian. She said that no one almost vomits over dick, and this wasn't just one time, it was multiple. But I'm sure ace people experience that? So I researched signs of being lesbian, and I related to a lot of them. I forgot what it was called, but it was that huge google doc. 

One that stood out to me was that I get rid of relationships because of stupid shit, and I also never have celebrity crushes. With Big Time Rush, I thought none of them were hot, but I just picked one and went with it. I do think a couple of men now are hot, but they're obviously unattainable. I've also had crushes on older men, which is typical. Also lots of people in high school (especially the gay people) thought I was gay. 

But when I saw the point about not being happy with a man, I began to cry. I always had this idealized dream of marrying some hot ass Italian guy, and we'd be so happy. But I know that isn't true. I'm pretty sure I wouldn't be happy with a man, even the hot ass Italian guy. I don't know about a woman. I don't know if I'd be happy with anyone. I'm shit at being emotional and shit at relationships. Like maybe if I married someone I was just hanging out with I'd be happy. 

I hate to say it, but I don't want to be a lesbian. I think I thought I was bi and ace because it includes being straight somehow. With this, I'm fully gay, and my family can be assholes to me about it. Also if I end up being asexual homoromantic, that's even worse, because it's even harder to find people like that to date. 

But idk. Obviously only I would know, but what do you ladies think? I am so confused aaaAAAAAA.",actuallesbians,1578192814,OfLittleGrease,,3,True,2020-01-04

6439,I (38 F) sent FB msg to an ex lover (28 F) after 3 years of no contact...,"I need help wondering what I should think about this one. I’m hoping a lot of you girls can help me because I was curious what you think.  I’m not feeling any sort of angst or sadness but I’m just so confused...

I messaged an ex lover about a week ago after 3 years of NC, and I told her that I missed her and she took about five hours to get back to me and she told me that basically, “You’ll never believe this... but I was thinking about you yesterday; about the January 1st that I spent the night with you and it was very wonderful...”

We texted a little bit more (not important) and then I told her that I missed her again and that I thought that she was beautiful. She told me that I was beautiful too and that she hopes to see me again someday.  I told her that I would like that too. 

A few days later this realization of what she had told me caught up to me and my hormones got the best of me so I sent another fb msg to her that I couldn’t concentrate at work bc of what she said.  She didn’t respond so then I asked her if I offended her or scared her to which she said not at all. She then proceeded to tell me that she’s been in a serious relationship for over a year and that she respects her girlfriend and so she can’t talk to me anymore. 

I of course was confused, told I didn’t interpret that from our chat, and ended up telling her that the way she was talking to me is not appropriate when you’re in a relationship with someone else. She thought we were just having a friendly conversation.  But I think that she understood what I was saying about how you can’t talk like that still so she said she was sorry. I also apologized and told her that perhaps I should’ve reached out before now, missed my chance. She hasn't replied since.  

There’s so much more backstory but I’ll leave it like that for now. The night that she was thinking about is the night that I basically told her we couldn’t have any more sex because she wasn’t serious about me but she begged me so I gave in....

6446,reading stone butch blues and this hit me hard," “If I’m not with a butch everyone just assumes I’m straight. It’s like I’m passing too, against my will. I’m sick of the world thinking I’m straight. I’ve worked hard to be discriminated against as a lesbian.” 

specifically the 'i've worked hard to be discriminated against as a lesbian' bit (but bi in my case). like, people look at 'stereotypical' feminine women and just think 'oh, straight.' usually also along with vapid and shallow and two dimensional. i've noticed throughout our history femmes have been sort of looked down upon and not seen as having as much depth or as many complicated feelings towards gender, gender roles, and femininity as a whole. 

my relationship with my womanhood, my attraction to women, my gender as a whole, my gender presentation....they're all much more complex than people would think from just looking at me on the street. and i felt that so hard about only being seen as not straight when with a butch, or just with another woman in general, which is why i USE femme. it's a way to express that even though i am very what one would call ""stereotypical"" feminine, it's not in a stereotypical way. it's not for male consumption, and it's not just about looking pretty to appease society's standards of what a woman should be/should look like.

if i'm not VISIBLY queer in some way, no one thinks it's possible for me to be so. it becomes especially frustrating when, being bisexual, i date a man for a while and people think i'm straight because of that as well. it's genuinely painful to forcibly be seen as something i'm not, as someone i'm not. it's uncomfortable too because i don't really relate to anything at all in cishet culture anymore. i'm so distanced from them as a whole that being seen as one of them is. just baffling to me.

i've worked damn hard the last 12 years i've been out to be Out. to be out, loud, and visibly proud. it sucks when people see me and just think i'm a straight girl and think i don't have all these complex feelings towards myself and my identity. 

anyway, this book is incredible and if you can handle super heavy content (rape, police brutality, violent homophobia and transphobia, racism) i'd definitely recommend reading it if you're into lesbian history and queer history in general really.",actuallesbians,1578200850,neurobiverse,,7,True,2020-01-05

It's been almost 11 months, and I think each day a part of me is still adjusting to a life without you in it. Without the person I thought would be a constant in my life, to hold me through the good times and the bad. I'm still figuring out what that means, and what that life looks like.

I still miss you. I still love you. I'm still angry at you. I still hate you. I hate you for hurting me the way you did. I'm angry at myself for not doing enough to keep you and not always treating you as well I should have. I'm angry at you for not loving me enough to stay. I still can't think about that last holiday without feeling angry and heartbroken. It's hard. Accepting that we aren't meant to be together is one of the hardest things I've ever had to do.

But at the same time, in some ways I have moved on. I've changed. I've grown. I've become stronger, more self-sufficient, more sociable, more balanced. I've learnt new ways of dealing with things. I've put my energy into other areas of my life, into building on my friendships and my hobbies. I've learnt a lot. I'm not the same person I was with you any more. 

There's days I think I'm getting closer to being over you, and days I don't even feel close. It's a journey, made up of small steps. Sometimes made up of 1 step forward, 2 steps backwards. I'm trying to remind myself to be kind to myself, and to be patient. To not put pressure or deadlines on myself. To let myself heal at the pace I need to, without any rush or judgement.

6481,baby lesbian questions about dating in such a small community,"When I came out I basically got together with the first girl I dated. Now I’m single again and I want to date casually.

I thought I was straight all my life, but every now and then I sneakily switched to “women looking for women” on my dating apps. I’m pretty shocked about the fact that now that I’m using them for real, I see the same faces all over again. I’ve made out with four women so far and I’ve seen them all in my feed on the very first day I’ve installed tinder. I checked out the lesbian groups on meetup - again, a lot of familiar faces. I see the same girls on every single one of the rare lesbian events in town. 

It stresses me out. First of all, why are the same women on those apps for so long, when they state they’re looking for relationships in their bio? Is it really so hard to find a girlfriend?? Have I just had immense luck to find one so fast? Will I be single forever if I don’t date to marry ASAP? 

And also - if the scene is so so small, how can you even date without being in it for the long run? 
Obviously being upfront and honest right from the start is important, but even if they are on the same page as me - if we end it in a way that isn’t super ideal and friendly, we will run into each other all the time? Isn’t that super awkward? When I date a girl from tinder and we are at a lesbian party, everyone else will have seen us on tinder and like, probably most people around us were our matches once??? I know that this isn’t necessarily a bad thing but it’s still weird, no? And what if someone messes up and does something really shitty in their relationship, are they done with dating in that town because everyone will know? With straight people, it’s a no-go to date anyone they dated before if you want to be their friend in any way and absolutely forbidden if you’re close, but how is that handled in the wlw community? If you can’t date anyone your friends have been dating once, there’s no one left - not to date, *and* not to be friends with. 

And- when I met my ex girlfriend we deleted the app, of course. I was worried about not explaining that I met someone to the other girls I was talking to (no deep conversations, as I said things happened fast with my ex so it hasn’t been more than the initial smalltalk) but she said it was fine to just delete the account and move on. Well now I’m back on tinder and afraid of talking to them again - but there aren’t many options and they’re still my type. Is it okay to start talking to them again?? Or is that a really weird move? On straight tinder this would be amazingly creepy.

6485,How to find your style/look more androgynous?,"CW: Body image, I guess

I'm having a small crisis about my style. It started with hair. I've had short and long hair - anything between a buzz cut and bra strap length, including the 2009 Bieber hair... Currently I have a shoulder-length bob cut. I originally got my long hair cut because I was inspired by Erika Linder in Below Her Mouth (yes, I am that gay). I wanted that messy, cool look but sadly my hair doesn't work that way. I had to put a lot of effort into making it look ""messy"" and even then I didn't really achieve the same look. Now that my hair is a bit longer, I find that not using conditioner or brushing my hair makes it look a bit more ""messy"" (but like, I don't have any major tangles &amp; I don't really care about the ""health"" of my hair because it's just dead proteins anyway). However, I'm thinking of cutting my hair again because the length is getting annoying and I mostly wear my hair in a bun (the ""takes 5 seconds"" type) anyway. 

The question is, how should I cut my hair? I used to dream of having some sort of undercut, but now the thought of having to shave the sides and back every n weeks sounds exhausting (even though I own a clipper) - I've become used to not cutting my hair for several months. In fact, before I got my chin-length bob, I only went to the hairdresser once a year! (My hair is pretty basic, straight and medium brown - I've never dyed it - if that makes any difference)

Also, I'm not happy with how my body looks. And by this I don't mean the usual ""I don't like my body"" stuff. I'm normal weight and I don't think I'm ""fat"", but I just don't like how the fat in my body is distributed in my thighs, boobs, and butt. I never really liked having boobs, mine are pretty small - but not small enough. I always wear a sports bra because they're comfortable and they also make my chest look smaller. I did use a binder for a couple of years but I don't anymore. However, my biggest problem is my ass. Don't get me wrong, I love curvy thighs, butts, and breasts *on other women,* but I just don't want to have them myself. Do you guys know any ways to get a more androgynous body? I guess I'd have to do more sports. Right now not much of that gets done (depression, you know how it is). But any other tips? Also, from what I've understood, gym workouts make your thighs and butt bigger, but firmer, right? I don't want that, either. I'm not personally looking for a ""fit"" look, I just want to look ""sporty"", I guess. (Again, I do think fit women look great, but that's not for *me*.) So, I guess I just need to lose some weight? My BMI is around 21.7. I'm not looking to lose weight *per se*, I just want to look a bit more androgynous.

Moving on to clothes. Basically, I often see clothes I like but when I try them on, they just... don't look nice *on me*. When someone else wears them, they look great. Probably the biggest issue is my broad shoulders. Finding shirts that don't look weird is a nightmare. Also, I like wearing flannels and button-down shirts but whenever I do, I basically look like a dude... :/

Then there's the pants issue. I don't know what kind of pants would look good on me. I don't want to highlight my thighs and ass so I rarely wear women's pants, but men's pants (something like [these](https://cdnc.lystit.com/photos/d3a2-2014/11/01/asos-blue-stretch-tapered-jeans-in-light-wash-product-1-25129129-0-236994910-normal.jpeg)) look like there's too much stuff going on at the butt area and too little at the front (like there's just too much fabric for my lack of male genitalia).

 I just wish I could look like a \~cool androgynous lesbian\~, not a ""girl who's wearing men's clothes"". This is especially true with my suit - I'm going to wear a suit to my graduation, but I don't want to look like I'm 5 and just tried on my dad's huge clothes (yes, I used to do that). I'm probably going to get the jacket altered a bit to avoid that impression... it is my size, but the proportions of my (cis woman) body aren't exactly what the jacket is made for.

6495,to shot my shot or to not shoot my shot,"Hello! This is my first time posting!

So, I'm 21 and in college. I've matched with the same girl (also 21, at a different college) multiple times on different dating apps over the past month or so. Once when we matched about a month ago, she messaged first, we had a quick conversation and she asked for my snap. We snapped back and forth for a few days a lot, but we weren't really talking much and also I was taking a really long time to open and reply (fully my b, I don't really use snapchat that much) and the snaps slowly stopped. Then, we match on a different dating app again recently. I messaged her first, we both sent a couple messages, then she said something about how we had already matched on another app. I responded to that, and it's been days and she hasn't responded. 

I think this girl is really cool, and I would like to get to know her better! As you all know, it's really difficult to find someone on a dating app that I'm actually excited about. So, my question is, should I shoot my shot? And if so, what would be the best way? Do I double message in the dating app messages and be honest and either give her my number or ask for hers? Or do I snapchat her out of the blue, since I already have her snapchat?

6498,I need advice guys,"So my girlfriend of 2.5 years just broke up and I just don't know what to do. I apologize for the wall of text, I just don't know what to do anymore. I'm going to try to be as objective as possible about this.



We've been basically very happy for about 2 years. The last few months we've been out of sync and we couldn't figure out why. Either I would feel off and she would feel fine, or she would off and I would feel fine. The last month or so we've both been kinda off. I was to spend about 1.5 weeks at home for the holidays for vacation from work and the last day I left, we talked about very openly about how weird we've been feeling.  She said she just feels so bored with life, and I agreed. We both have undergone big chances over the last 2 years and we always had each other to lean on. But for the last 6 months, things have been very stable, and we our dynamic has changed. It's not that we've taken each other for granted, we love each other very much. But we just fell into a rut and a routine. Then I left for the holidays. The first day that I was back that we really had time to sit down and talk about this thing that was hanging in the air between us, she broke up with me.




She said she didn't realize it until the holidays but she has been so miserable and sad lately. She says she looked in the mirror one day and realized she didn't like what she saw. She said she has always felt incredibly responsible for my emotional health (I have a long history of issues but I've been stable for 2 years since I've been on the right medication) and she says that takes a toll on her. She said she feels the need to always be the positive one and be ""on"" all the time. She said she is emotionally drained and has no mental space for anything at all anymore because she's just so consumed with sadness and anxiety and confusion over not really knowing what she's doing given how dissatisfied with herself she's been lately. I said that I understood but that I felt that couples sometimes can feel out of sync but that they work together to come back together, even if there's no clear path forward. Eventually, you figure out how to work in sync again. She said she agreed, but that she was so emotionally tired she just kept saying ""I have no more emotional give left in me"".




I'm a very grumpy person, and she's naturally a very happy bright person. She's always reminding me of ways to better myself, and I've always admired her for it. She makes me want to try to be a better person and I've learned a lot from her. But isn't that how it's supposed to go? She always said I make her want to better herself too, so its a mutual feeling. But my grumpiness has always been a point of contention, and it's something I've had to work on very hard. I guess it's slowly taken its toll...







Our lives were incredibly intertwined, though I don't think it was in too unhealthy of a way. Her roommates are some of my closest friends, which makes the situation a little hairy and I know it will make me feel extremely alone for a while. Hopefully we can all find a way to stay in contact without things being weird but who knows. 






I'm frustrated with her. We established that there was this problem right before I left for the holidays and the day of the break up was the first chance to see her in person where it was just the two of us to talk and address the matter. I feel like once you realize there's an issue, shouldn't you at least try to work on it for some time before throwing in the towel? I feel like she called it quits very early on. 






That said, she was explaining how the last few months have been incredibly draining. She says that she has always felt incredibly emotionally responsible for my and trying to keep me optimistic (which I never asked for but I can see why she might feel that obligation) and that between that and listening to my problems with work, she has very little emotional space. Her exact words were ""I've been running on empty for months without realizing it."" She brought up issues that I either never realized were a problem or recognized were potential problems and had been trying to be better about even though we never explicitly addressed them. For example, she said she felt like we never talked about work and when she got her job she felt like I never really discussed it with her. Which I felt is untrue, but that's how she feels. Or she talked about how our sex life had become stale, which I recognized was an issue. Every time one of us would try to initiate the other was just feeling off and it made it hard for both of us to a time where we both synced up. Plus both of us being girls and having our periods on separate weeks didn't help. But I was trying for sure. My psych meds have really killed my sex drive and I felt guilty about that.





I voiced my opinion that, yeah, couples sometimes go out of sync and sometimes it's for a long time but eventually you work together and you find your way back into your groove. That's how long term relationships are supposed to be. She agreed but I could see just how distraught she was and I know she really is so emotionally drained. While I'm ticked that she threw in the towel, I also get what it feels like to be so emotionally strained that all you can think to do is shut down on everyone and just look out for yourself. I get that relationships require a large chunk of emotional endurance and that has to be difficult to keep up when you're feeling that awful. I am frustrated, but in reality I can see how much she's hurting and I think that breaks my heart maybe more than the breakup itself. More than anything, I wish we were still together just so I could be there for her. Though I guess if she felt like I could fulfil that role, maybe we wouldn't have broken up in the first place. I think I was an emotional burden to her, the way she puts it, and while that hurts I just want her to be okay. 





Jesus I feel terrible. I miss her. And not just the comfort of being in a relationship with her. I miss her as a person.





We both agreed we love each other very much, that we were happy together until recently, and that we feel like we are pretty good for each other. I want to respect her space and obviously give her time to process and emotionally recover. But I didn't have to words to articulate a lot of the stuff I've said above, and I never got the chance to say what I felt, which I feel like I deserve to say too.



I guess my questions is whether or not I should ask to speak with her. Obviously after some time for her to take a second for herself. I'm not typically the sort to pander after their ex and ask for them back, but this feels like a situation where we just need some space for a little bit and could possibly come back together after some time to work on ourselves. Should I chat with her about this?

6499,to shoot my shot or to not shoot my shot!,"Hi, this is my first time posting here! I'll try to keep this short and sweet.

I'm 21 and in college. I've matched with this one girl, also 21, at a different college, on several different dating apps over the past couple months. About a month ago, she started a conversation on this one app that was fun and we both messaged really fast, and she quickly asked for my snap. We snapped a lot for a few days, mostly pictures, but it fizzled out after a while cause it was mostly just pics and I took a lot time to respond because I don't use snap that much (fully my b). Then, recently, we matched again on a different app. I messaged first this time, we both sent a few messages and took a while to respond, and then she said something about us matching again. I responded to that, and it's been a few days and she hasn't responded. 

So, my question is, is it desparate to be up front and shoot my shot? If I shoot my shot, what would be the best way to go about it? Either double messaging her on the app and either asking for her number or giving her mine, or should I snap her out of the blue? Or do I cut right to the chase and ask to meet her? 

OR, am I just wasting my time because it seems like she's not interested? I can't tell if she has stopped responding in conversations because I've been taking a long time to message/snap back, and I figured that if she wasn't interested she wouldn't have matched again and again, but I don't know.

She then drove me back to work and we made out in her car for a little while and shes a really good kisser and my heart is just gonna explode rn.

I need to up my kissing game a bit but I think itll also get better as we become more in sync. On the drive at the end we held hands and she sang one of those cute Colbie Caillat love songs (I cant remember which one rn bc my brain is exploding) and she said shes falling head over heels for me!!!!!

I worry because I'm not the best at communication and compliments, my best friend growing up hated them so I'm kinda conditioned not to give them but A is REAALY complementary (which I love) so I wanna reciprocate! So I'm gonna work on my compliment giving and communication skills, as well as work on syncing up with her a bit better when we kiss (it wasnt bad, just a tad awkward as we kept making moves at different times so we bumped noses a bit but nothing too bad), but I'm super excited to be in a new relationship with A and though we havent known each other super long (less than a month with only a few dates bc we both have crazy schedules and the holidays and everything), I totally feel like a uhaul lesbian bc I'm falling in love with her and am just so head over heels enamoured with her!!!! I'm moving out soon (and am about to turn 21, shes about to turn 22) and where I'm moving she won't ever be allowed to stay the night due to the agencies policies but I still think we are gonna have a lot.of fun and good times and all as long as we are still together knock on wood which I really hope for!

Anyways that's my rant before I go home to my homophobic mother, if you read this thanks for listening I'm so fucking excited and happy and falling in love and AAAAAAH",actuallesbians,1577499256,ILikeYourBoots41,,1,True,2019-12-27

I moved back to my 3,000 person conservative hometown in August to teach. My goal was to be a “more liberal” example of humanity to kids who feel smothered and stuck in their high school years. We have several gay and trans students in my high school with no one to talk to. 

I’ve been able to have very heartfelt conversations with these kids while keeping my LGBT identify a secret. I truly feel that I’ve already made a difference in one semester. But I have also had two different parents ask their kids if I’m gay because I’m 30 and single. 

I’m now searching for a “boyfriend” for school events just so I don’t lose my job. I hate everything about this. 

Just going through a really hard time and wanted to get it off my chest. I have a kid that’s a junior who has told me I’ve saved her from suicide.

6535,I finally came out to my sister and her response made me cry (in a good way!),"I grew up in a very conservative rural community where I was taught that gay people were dangerous and a burden on society. My family had a much kinder outlook, but the pressure to perform heterosexuality was still a huge part of my life. I realized I was queer sometime in high school, but it wasn’t safe for me to come out. I started quietly identifying as bisexual around 18, telling only one or two people at the time. Then, when I moved hundreds of miles away for college, I sort of overcompensated by being as loud as possible about my identity, coming out to anyone and everyone I met. I never felt any fear or shame in wearing my queerness like a badge at my very liberal college, and for the first time in my life I felt 100% myself. 

After a couple of disappointing relationships with men, I was sort of slammed with the reality that I was a lesbian when I was 20. I was in a relationship with a great guy at the time, and a lot of tears and heartache accompanied my realization and our inevitable split. Then came the process of coming out to people a second time, trying to situate myself within the queer community in the process. It was an awkward transition, but I made it through thanks to the support of communities like this one. 

Despite finally feeling happy and secure in my identity, I never came out to my family. I was almost certain they’d accept me, but the idea that they might suddenly show their true colors and reject me weighed heavy on my mind. Years had passed since I started identifying as queer, and now I’m 22. I recently decided enough was enough and came out as gay to my sister. It took all my courage to do it, and I nearly threw up, but I did it! 

Her response? “Oh, yeah, I already knew.” I was stunned. While I had been out to my friends and coworkers at college for years, the likelihood of my sexuality making it through the grapevine to her was slim. I asked her what she meant, and she listed all this evidence that I had never associated with my queerness before. When I was a child, I was a huge tomboy who refused to wear dresses or makeup. I’ve continued to present androgynously even as an adult, but generally still within the realm of “straight-passing”.  She also more jokingly mentioned my love of cats, my attendance at pride parades, and the fact that I was *really* into being a good ally in high school. When she laid it out like that, i felt ridiculous for not realizing how obvious my sexuality had been for my entire life. That knowledge, coupled with the relief of no longer hiding in the closet, left me ugly crying in the passenger seat of my sister’s car. 

I realize that my identity goes beyond a few shallow stereotypes about my appearance, interests, or behavior, but there’s something incredibly validating in knowing that the signs were there before I even knew it. I’m entering the new year with a newfound confidence in my identity, and I’m so happy I can finally leave this massive weight in the past :)",actuallesbians,1577510854,Yggdrasil-,Lesbian,1,True,2019-12-28
6536,I hate my body and I’m terrified for other girls to see me naked,I don’t know where to begin but I hate my body so much.  There’s not one thing about it I like but what I really hate is my stomach my boobs and my cellulite.  I feel like I have more cellulite than anyone else on earth like it’s literally all over my upper thighs and I can’t stand it . My stomach is nowhere near flat and protrudes outward when I’m not sucking it in and no matter how much or how little I eat and workout it’s still the same.  My breasts look like the most abnormal thing on earth. Not only do they have a sag to them and I’ve never even had kids but nipples are HUGE...I remember one girl I was hooking up with told me that my nipple is almost the size of my hand and that in her 26 years of being a lesbian she’d never seen nipples so big.  If that’s not embarrassing enough I got told my multiple people that my body is pretty nasty.  The sad part is that I’m attracted to skinny girls with toned abs and perky and round breasts and I can just picture the disgusted look on their faces if they see me naked.  I constantly compare myself to them and then I’m not even sexually interested anymore because I realize my body is nowhere near as good as theirs.  I cry myself to sleep at night knowing I can’t do anything about it and I’m dreading and terrified of the day a girl I’m attracted to and like will see me naked.,actuallesbians,1577511046,placeoftemptation,,1,True,2019-12-28

6539,"Don't date girls with violently homophobic parents, please just don't.","We've been going to the same schools for 15 years and got closer over the summer, after a few dates she told me she wasn't looking for anything serious because her parents were homophobic and she couldn't date anyone until she moved out. I said I didn't mind, I'm not the type of person to need to be out and proud and meet my girlfriend's parents etc. Her parents were kinda strict but ultimately were just confused why she suddenly started seeing me every weekend, we played it off as girl besties of course but they didn't even let her sleep over at mine.

She was a few weeks away from turning 18 and we thought they'd be a bit more lenient once she was an adult. Things were looking good, we booked a holiday for her birthday to London and they seemed fine with it. A week before the holiday, her brother figured out we were dating and started making ""jokes"" about her being gay in front of their parents. She'd say ""eww no why would you say that"" and her brother would say ""you're always with peachychamomile, she's your girlfriend!"". She tried to brush it off and even told her parents I had a boyfriend and showed pics of me and my male best friend to pretend we were dating. 

It all turned into a big web of lies that I didn't realise would happen, her father would say if she was gay she would be disowned. I had nightmares about being hurt because in her home country they would stone gay people to death. My parents (fortunately they are very accepting) warned me to be very careful. I tried to talk to her about it and she said it was worth it because of how happy I made her. I had to make a choice, and as much as I liked her I don't think a couple of months of a teenage relationship is worth being possibly disowned or worse.

She acted like I just told her I'd cheated on her or something, it was horrible and I broke her heart. I feel so stupid for thinking everything would be okay, but growing up in an accepting family I didn't understand how bad it could be. The threat didn't feel real as we were just happy together, until it was a real threat.

I'm not gonna make this mistake again, I'm so sorry for teenage lesbians with homophobic parents but if you could possibly be disowned or hurt just because you're spending a lot of time with a girl then please think about whether a teenage relationship is worth it and please don't get yourself hurt. I hope I can still be friends with my ex and I hope when she moves out next year she can be free to date who she wants, but for now it was just hurting us both.",actuallesbians,1577514089,peachychamomile,,1,True,2019-12-28

Cuddled under a blanket, snuggled real close while we attempt to find the planets and she tells me about different galaxies. Music softly playing from my phone sitting in the driver's seat. Cool air wafting over us, bringing the scent of her cologne evermore strongly to my senses. God, I want to see her face enveloped in awe, being able to actually see the milky way. I want her to hold my hand and play with my hair with the other. Petting me gently, almost lulling me to sleep. Then a song she likes comes on the shuffle and she sings along, boosting my melatonin, introducing me to soft dreams. I'll dream of us, with our own place, a large farm with a cow, some sheep and a border collie. Maybe even some hens. I'll ride up from picking fresh foods like strawberries and blackberries and such, to find her waiting on something she was baking talking to the cow. Then I wake up in the morning after having that cute ass dream to my Aunt's rooster being the unit of an alarm he is. I lean over and kiss my girlfriend on the forehead, saying, ""Babyyy, wake upp."" She groggily opens her eyes and smiles at me. She asks if I wanna go swimming, I say yes and that I know the perfect place. I drive us there, we get out, get down to our underwear. She's smiling wide as fuck at me and starts giggling, then she'll chase me and tickle me and I'll run into the water and we'll stop. We'll look at eachother. She'll seem hesitant cause she never learned how to swim cause she was always terrified of the open water. I'll take her hands, I'll say, ""Do you trust me?"" She'll say yes. I'll take her deeper so she can touch but she can still float and I'll say reassuringly, ""I've got you, love. Its alright."" She'll get to where she's floating, I'll teach her the mechanics. Soon, she'll have it and I'll have a big dumb smile and say all giddy, ""You're doing it! I'm so proud of you!"" She'll blush, I'll say I love her. She'll say she loves me too.

Here it goes: the other day I was having a discussion with my straight male colleague. We had a casual gathering and a female coworker dropped a piece of pizza on her shirt on her chest. I pointed it out (if I spilled my food I would like it if people told me) and he was surprised I told her without hesitations (because it was pretty much on her boob). He was telling me about how he is being conscious when interacting with female coworkers, not to cause any #metoo situations. He was wondering if I, as a gay lady, felt the same.  I had to admit that I never hold back because I’m gay. Okay, I’m somewhat reluctant toward my coworkers, but that a hierarchy thing: him and I are doctors, most others are nurses. 
Many of my coworkers are quite touchy-feely with eachother, so are most of my (all straight) friends, all in a platonic way. I never really thought about it. And I don’t think any of my friends or coworkers see me any different, just because I’m the gay one. 
So, anyone who recognizes this? Do you feel the need to behave different / more conservative because of your sexuality?",actuallesbians,1577552794,nicksmoet,,1,True,2019-12-28

6583,What do first/second lesbian dates look like for you?,"I’m a bit of a serial dater and yet it hasn’t gotten easier. I really like this particular girl - we went on a couple of dates a year ago but stopped cause she lived too far away. Now she’s moving to my city for school and I’m taking her out this week.

I really don’t want to blow it but I’m always so, so fucking nervous about kissing and even touching people. I couldn’t just go and kiss a girl to save my life. When I can sense that a girl wants to kiss me I go fucking feral and blush so hard and basically become paralyzed and often girls think it’s cute but it’s so nerve-wracking. I especially get nervous at the end of dates when kissing typically happens, and I usually chicken out. We are going skating &amp; I’m an awful skater so I’m hoping she’ll let me grab onto her for support and maybe that will be enough contact for our “first” date.

We both fulfill the classic useless lesbian trope. We’ve never kissed or touched much. I literally barely ever kiss girls on dates and never hold hands but I want to do those things. She has never wholly dated a girl so she’s probably also nervous which might mean she’s expecting me to take the lead but I’m SO BAD AT THAT.

How do y’all get over these fears? What’s the worst that could happen if I kissed her? How do I just hold her hand? What if I do and she secretly doesn’t like it or something? Is it okay if we don’t kiss or directly hold hands or do you think she’d be disappointed? Should I tell her about this feeling or would she judge me/get more nervous?

6585,I agreed to be just friends with benefits like she wanted. Does public display affection counts? or its just sex? I am all new to this.,"I thought it just sex but we can't keep ourselves not close to each other in public. Like one time, after we had sex, we were going to this one place so we rode a bus and she put her arm around me, playing with my neck or waist. Sometimes we hold hands while walking. Sometimes she put her head in my shoulder and tells me she like that I smell so good or kiss my head. One time she put her ring on my finger suddenly and I was surprised by that. And she giggles when I look at her. And other public display of affection that people might think that we are a couple. 

I playfully tried to tell her what if her friends saw what we were doing and they might think we are a couple, she said she was fine by that. I asked her if she really likes public display of affection and she replied that she doesn't really like to do it (she has other friends with benefits too) but with me, she can't help it and she doesn't know why. 

I am confused cause I really like her but what she showing me kind of tells me that she might like me as well but just denying it or that was just all ""friends with benefits"" act.",actuallesbians,1577564487,jenchu21,,1,True,2019-12-28

6590,Had a nice chat that I’d been wanting to have with my dad tonight,"For context, I’m working on figuring out my sexuality bc I go back and forth in my head but I’m trying not to put too much pressure on myself about it because it’ll work itself out in due time and I’m in a really nice casual thing right now with a guy that knows what’s up. 

I spent Christmas abroad this year, as I’m in England for my masters degree, and my family is in the US. Was catching up with my dad and he asked what I did for Christmas, and I told him I spent it with my friends and this guy I’ve been seeing. He jokingly asked if this guy was sure of his identity (because literally every guy I’ve dated has come out as bi/pan either while or after I’ve dated them) and I said no, he’s very sure of himself (also bisexual, but I didn’t tell my dad that lol), but I haven’t been. And as I started to launch into it, he just said “I know.” And I stopped and I was like “oh, mom did tell you?” And he said “yeah, of course.”

Anyway, I gave him the gist of what’s been going on in my head, and this wonderful Catholic man said “You know where Mom and I stand on that, you know I love you no matter what. There’s nothing you could do that would change that, except if you were a serial killer.”

Just felt nice to hear that from him and not having my mom speak for him. I’ve been out to him as bisexual for years now, so I’m sure this is in part to him having time to adjust and be cool with it.   And now that he knows this, and didn’t try to stop me or shut me up because he was uncomfortable talking about feelings, it was just really wonderful.",actuallesbians,1577571199,dfnrml2351,,1,True,2019-12-28

While bisexuality and pansexuality are completely valid,  I find the notion that *all* women are sexually fluid to be kind of gross.

6600,Why do some people think they have the right to out other people?,"I’m more or less annoyed at the moment. 

Why and how do some people think they have the right to out someone else, especially when they themselves are even a part of the LGBTQ+ and know how hard it can be for people to come out? I’m honestly baffled by this.

I have this one friend, she’s an openly proud bisexual herself. A few months back, i came out to her as lesbian, since she was the only LGBTQ+ person i knew irl at the time and who i trusted deeply. She was happy for me, and was excited for me about my crush.

Fast forward 3 weeks from that, my friend invited me and my crush over for some netflix and chill together, we plop on a movie, everything goes nicely, we’re all having fun, until. My friend makes a very highkey comment about me being gay. In front of my crush, who i was trying to get over for a long time already. Well, no one really comments anything on it and we continue watching the movie, then my friend decides that it’s a good idea to ”tease” with me a little and pushes me on to my crush. I’m almost on top of her and we’re both very uncomfortable, then my friend proceeds to say ”aww you 2 would make a cute couple”. 

Later on, a month or so, we’re in art school (me, my crush, and my friend all go to the same art school, we’re in the same class) and the issue of LGBTQ+ rights rises in the conversation. Everyone is extremely supportive in that group and they all accept gays. My friend yet again, makes a very highkey comment about me being a lesbian. Everyone just looks at me a little weird and look at her, but (fortunately) nobody commented anything on it.

Then, the most recent case. It’s the last day of school before christmas break, i’m sitting with a friend of mine (we’ll call her S) on some couches. My bi friend (who i’ll call B now) comes and sits with us, she starts talking about how she finally came out as bi to her parents that morning. She’s very happy because her parents were very supportive, i’m happy for her too and congratulate her. Then, as we’re moving to another subject, i mention to S that i’m annoyed by something. B very loudly asks me ”what? Annoyed that you haven’t been able to come out to your parents yet?” I’m just sitting there extremely confused and trying to act like i have no idea what she’s talking about. S looks at me weirdly and then looks at B, fortunately she just left it at that and didn’t comment anything on it.

I would’ve mentioned to B right then and there that that was extremely rude to do and she has no right to even joke about that, but i didn’t since i didn’t want to make her feel like shit after being so happy because of her parents.

And yes, i have told her on multiple instances that i’m simply not ready to come out to people yet, that i’ll take my time and come out when i’m ready. Yet she still does things like that.",actuallesbians,1577577227,Postbezorger,,4,True,2019-12-28

Butch girls, who give off an aura of *cool* but, from time to time, can forget how to sit. (I see you there with your leg over the arm of the chair. It's comfy, relaxed, that's totally fair.)

Goth girls, scene girls, everything in between girls, who express themselves how they like with the confidence to just do them.

Shy girls, sad girls, girls that don’t give up - girls who deserve to love themselves because they’re worth it, even if the world has heavied their burdens.

Boss girls, who are large, in charge, and strut into the scene with their chin held high.

Soft girls, who are sensitive, empathetic, and are honestly just lesbian treasures, don’t lie.

I like geek girls, sweet girls, flaunt it in the street girls, because it doesn’t matter what you like or how you express it, you deserve to be proud.

I like cis girls, trans girls, I-don’t-like-your-label girls - all girls who are all valid - you’re all lovely women, you deserve to be here, you deserve to be loud.

I like out girls, closeted girls, girls who are unsure - I like you girls, and you all deserve support and the ability to love you for you, openly, freely, and unafraid.

I like girls who like girls - come how they may.

I like all girls, best girls - that’s all of you - because girls are the best, each and every one, regardless of your expression, identity, or idea of fun. You’re all valid, supported, and worthy thereof - because, you lovely lesbos, you’re all worthy of love.

And hopefully nothing I’ve said is obtuse,

Though I do feel a tad

like a gay Dr. Suess.

On the real though, around on reddit, I've seen some women worry about aspects of themselves or feelings they have, and I understand it a bit. Being a trans women who is interested in women has made me really think hard about myself, especially with so much of the negativity that floats around on this site. But I don't think people should put people down for just trying to be happy. So I just wanted to tell anyone who might be here, wondering about themselves, about their validity, wondering if they'll ever find someone, wondering if this or that about them brings into question whether or not they can find or even deserve love and happiness:

Hi there I'm 20 and only recently figured out I'm a lesbian. I've grown up in a rather culty religious environment and along with knowing close to nothing about my sexuality or myself in general -- due to like only finding information on anything in religious texts -- I don't know much about the real world or how science or life works. I'm a big jumbled mess.

I see lesbians talk about things I struggle with in articles and YouTube videos, but nothing is exact and I'd like to speak to some people who have lived stuff that can answer me directly.

The BIGGEST thing I struggle with is the residual religious mindsets. I don't so much feel guilt anymore? But I've grown up with strict gender roles and heteronormative everything forced upon me and genuinely don't know how to get past it. A friend sent me an essay that went in depth about ""compulsory  heterosexuality"" and after reading it and recognizing myself in every situation posed within it I realized that I wasn't allowing myself to be authentic and true.

So some things to know about me (trigger warning for religious brainwashing, religion in general, and sexual assault):
- I've always known I wasn't straight. 
- My first crush was on a girl.
- Parents and family and any friends around me were religious, homophobic, fundamentalist people. If someone was anything other than that they were dirty/sinners/bad influences and I often allowed that narrative to control my feelings/thoughts/decisions.
- I was sexually assaulted by a female friend when I was young also, but it made me scared of women. So this contributed to my aversion to them even as I've figured out I'm only attracted to them.
- We moved to a heavily conservative southern state when I was 15 and I got sent to a private christian school where I basically brainwashed myself into being straight for like three to four years. 
- I identified as bi until the first time I told my friends I was a lesbian.
- I chickened out of being a lesbian -- due to crushing amounts of internalized homophobia -- and went back to men for a few months.
- Finally confronted myself awhile ago. Figured out I was gay. I'm not letting myself torture myself with the back and forth, so I'm trying to figure out why I have such an issue with being a lesbian.

^^ That's all you really need to know. But I'm also going to write out the final moment I let myself accept I was gay.

The moment went as follows:

I was driving and listening to my gay music playlist and daydreaming. Literally thought to myself, ""Man I wish I could end up with a woman."" And then audibly said, ""What? Why can't I??"" And really thought about the answer to that question. I came out with, ""Because the only way I'll truly feel safe is with a man."" But then I was super confused because I knew that wasn't true. Like why did I think that? Why couldn't I feel safe or happy or comfortable with a woman? If I really thought about it, I knew I could. So where did that come from? I shelved it in my head for a few days until my friend called and came out to me as a lesbian. It got me thinking about the day in the car again and I didn't stop thinking about it and rolling around my past experiences in my head until I figured out I had to be a lesbian.

I'm pretty good and okay and solid in this and in me. Until moments like tonight when we watched a movie with Ashton Kutcher and I was thinking he's pretty attractive. And I questioned myself. When I do this I imagine the man in question topless (ew), imagine kissing them (ew²), and then /other things/ with them (EW³). I can't see myself in a relationship with a guy, especially not longterm, I really don't find myself ATTRACTED to them, I just find some of them objectively attractive. But this always plants doubts in my head. I just don't know how to untangle all these knots in my head.

So that's where I'm at. I just need to talk to some experienced people. I need stories and advice on how to make it through religious trauma when it comes to having a queer identity. And in general just how to cope with living life as a queer person.

I'm very lost, I don't have any readily available resources person-wise in my life. So anything helps.

So my relationship is going on 4 months, and although in most wlw relationships, this equals years, I feel like I'm just being dated and not being treated as a girlfriend. 

I suffer from severe migraines and when they get bad, I take medicine to which I blame my reactions and ""blowing things up/taking things personally"" on. Buuuuuuut idk guys, I need advice.

So, I'm not big on Christmas, I think there's too much pressure on everyone to rush and get things done by a certain date. If we get together as a family on the 24/25th, awesome. If not, no sweat. So I do my best to help get things done, shop for others, help out, etc. Which caused my migraine to come in Sunday afternoon, full blast Monday, and resulted in an ER visit Tuesday (Christmas Eve). 

One thing I have wanted and have said before to my partner is that when I feel bad, I'd like if she'd comfort me, sit with me, show some sort of compassion. I know I had told her I wasn't feeling well, that I had a headache and I wasn't up to hanging out with her friends. To which her text response was ""I'm sorry. I hope you feel better."" Well that set me off because is was hoping for ""anything I can do to help,"" but no, and I just said for her to enjoy her time with her friends and have fun doing her own thing. She never responded back

Well I got steadily worse and couldn't handle the pain Tuesday. I had very little communication with her and when I said I was going to the ER, no response, I called, no answer. She finally texted me back 30mins later as I'm sitting in the ER alone ""I'm sorry you're in that much pain""... So I called her told her I was alone, which ER I was at, and she said she was going over to a friend's house with her other friend (who happens to be her ex-wife). 

I sat in that ER alone for a few hours as they administered IV fluids and medication to bring down my migraines. I then went home and heard nothing from my girlfriend until the next morning... Christmas Day. I would've liked for her to have joined my family just to be a part of it, but she didn't. I had to wait until 4pm to see her and we then spent it with her ex-wife. She and her friend went on and on about how much fun they had, the amount of alcohol consumed, etc... I didn't say anything, just held my tongue and had a pissed off look.

After we left, she drove me home and asked why I was upset. I told her I didn't want to hear about her having fun with her friends, when I was alone at the ER. I told her how I felt and how it was not ok, her response was that I told her to ""do your own thing"".

I'm still not ok, I'm trying very hard to stay ahead of my migraines but here I am, alone as she spends time with her friends at the bar.

Yes, I did say for her to do her own thing, but doesn't your GF being in the ER supercede anything else? Am I Wrong to think that? Help me out guys, what do I do? My straight friends say I should end it.",actuallesbians,1577603503,imessedup1979,,1,True,2019-12-29

So my girlfriend and I have been dating for about 8 months. We love each other and things are really good. I just have some insecurities around the holidays.

Her parents are Catholic. She’s bi and dated guys in high school so they assume she is straight. She doesn’t want to tell them that she has a girlfriend, which I totally understand and I want to respect her wishes regarding that as much as I can.

She’s met my parents, who think she’s great.

Her parents think I am a friend who she bakes with.

I know that if she ever tells them that we are anything beyond that, it could strain or break her relationship with her family and I don’t want that for her. I’m a decent girlfriend, I think, but I don’t know if I’m “risk alienating your family” good. 

Her sister brought her boyfriend to meet the family this Christmas. They like and accept him. I’m just not feeling great about the situation and I’m sure it’s even harder for her. I don’t have a burning desire to meet her parents, but it just makes me kind of sad that I have to be a secret. It makes me sad that she has to keep me a secret when her previous relationships didn’t have to be. I don’t always get why she wanted to go out on a date with me.

This question triggers my OCD about my sexual orientation. It’s also very rude. I try to avoid this question by avoiding labels. In the past I even tried to avoid it by just telling people I’m bisexual since no one would believe I’m purely gay anyways. Not even me. But saying I’m bisexual just made people even more weird. I’d still get anti-lesbian comments. Like people would have to tell me about their lesbian friend who married a man. I wasn’t even claiming to be gay!,actuallesbians,1577610957,AngryFemmeDyke,,1,True,2019-12-29
6665,"""I see you everywhere !"" or The Princess and the Tech.","I'm a student and a pharm tech on the side, so I usually work two to three days a week in the same retail pharmacy. I'm also very bi and closeted at work just for my peace of mind or whatever, however I'm out everywhere else !  

Because I **hate** working in my college library (and since it's always full), I sometimes go to another college 10 minutes away to study without noise. I love going there. It's really peaceful, I know some people too, and the coffee is good and extra cheap.  
So one day I go to their cafeteria after studying, just to relax a bit, and I see a woman so stunning, wearing a flowing red dress, surrounded by like 10 people who all had her eyes on her. She looked like a princess, no joke, I was captivated, I couldn't take my eyes off her. Anyway ; it lasted about a few seconds and I went back to my coffee.  

Two weeks after, a friend of a friend from this school invited me to her DJ set with her other DJ friends in a queer bar. I said yes, maybe I'd go after work. So I clock out at 8pm, and go to this queer bar wearing an orange t-shirt because I love colours, and I'm pretty sure it makes people merrier (it makes me stand out at least, plus I thought I looked good).  

After the first set (and three G and Ts), I felt hot so I got outside to get some fresh air since the bar was so packed, and to chat a bit with other people. My guy friend followed me outside then, and saw a person to whom he said hello to and it was her. The Princess, with a friend. My heart skipped a bit and honestly I was getting real drunk and she looked like an angel, she has such a beautiful smile... I asked her her name (that she gave me, along with a nickname) and if we ever met before and she told me that but didn't know where we could have met.  She got outside to talk to her other friends.
During the conversation (8 people), Idk, our eyes crossed, and we looked at each other for, like, 10 seconds. I thought I was hallucinating but I was pretty sure *something had happened* during that silent exchange. Then she got inside again. She told me goodbye when she left and I thought it was the end of it (she literally disappeared in the night before I could ask for her contact, and I had forgotten her name since I didn't hear it properly and I was not sober... Shame on me.)  

Fast forward to yesterday. I was so tired at work, so many Rx's to fill, same old day...  
Then someone got in, guess who ?  
INDEED, *The Princess*, looking tired and sick af with a cold. I thought I would *never* see her again.  
I recognised her immediately, I was *shook*, but it felt weird, it felt like my boss (the RPh) knew her. And then she got to my counter asking for cold medicine that I got her obviously.  
After that, I told her that we met several times before, and she asked me if I was in her school (I didn't lie and told her everything), then talked about the DJ set at the bar and she ended up telling me ""You were the girl in orange ?"", my brain was like **""!!!!!!!!!!!!!""** and she looked very surprised as well. Then she gave me her name (won't tell but it was a beautiful Arabic name like Layeil) and we talked for a little while – I was still at the counter, thankfully the RPh was busy and there was no one else behind.  
Then I said, ""It's funny, I see you everywhere, but it's nice to see you"" and she replied by ""it's nice to see you too, we could get drinks after work if you want"". She was beaming and I was like fuck FUCK FUCK so this party at the bar wasn't a fucking dream, this woman exists and she just invited me for drinks ?  
Then she gave me her number (I gave her mine too) and I stayed perfectly composed on the outside but I was still ????ing in my head.  
I then realised I had seen her before, because she's been going to the same damn pharmacy for months (mine) and I was so focused on filling other Rx's that my colleague (the second RPh) filled hers, and she always looked so happy to see him (she never really looked at me and me neither - I just thought she was pretty and nice) that I thought she had a crush on him and he had no idea. LITTLE DID I KNOW.  

So I see her next week for dinner !  

(She came bas 30 minutes after the this episode because she needed something else, and she smiled at me a lot while the RPh was getting it. Amazing day.)",actuallesbians,1577615152,leseptiemesceau,let me bi you a drink,1,True,2019-12-29

All Bette ever does is look in the window  and seem concerned. She needs a girlfriend to boss around so we can get some of that tension she once had with Tina. 

Alice is still kooky but I'm pissed they chose to ignore Tasha. It makes Alice come off as having experienced very little development and the whole talk show host bit is kinda lame. I wish Alice had matured.

6681,I'm very close to breaking up with my gf,"This post is just a way for me to get some pain and stress off of my chest and to help organize my thoughts. And also using a throwaway account for this as well.

My gf and I have been dating for almost a year now. We met on a dating app, and ever since I started talking to her I could feel myself being very attracted to her personality and the way she spoke. After a week or 2, we met each other for the first time and I fell head over heels for her. We became exclusive a month later, and since then we'd been going strong. The first few months were bliss, because it seemed that we never fought and if we had a little disagreement, it would resolve quick and everything would be alright. But for the past 3 months or so, we've all the sudden been fighting every single day- which often times alternates between one of us screwing up somehow and the other one not taking it well. I usually get upset with her when she crosses boundaries that I told her she's not allowed to cross (I'd be more specific, but if I said what it was then she'd read this and know it's me). I also get irritated sometimes when she doesn't help me with cleaning the house and I end up always being the one having to bring it up or doing it entirely. As for her, she gets upset with me over millions of things. Not texting her when she's at work (and I'm at home doing something). Not wrapping my Christmas presents early enough. Being too scared to hold her hand in public because I'm not fully out. Staying an extra two hours at my job instead of coming home to her. 

I know someone's going to point out ""hey, that's manipulative and controlling"" and for the record- yes, I've realized that about a month ago. I told her what she was doing was manipulative and unhealthy, and instead of owning up to it and apologizing, she just said ""oh I guess my ex was right then..."" and went on some sort of pity rant, which ultimately led to me having to comfort her instead of her apologizing to me and making sure what she can do to fix her behavior.

I don't know, we've been non stop fighting the past few months and it's taking up all of my energy. She recently told me that she feels that I'm not there for her or that I'm never there when she needs comfort, and at first I didn't know what to say or what the cause of the issue was. Now thinking back, I think I'm just mentally drained in this relationship. It's like my brain doesn't want to put any more work in and just wants to lay on cruise control. I'm afraid it may be because my subconscious is already done with her.

I still love her and have feelings, but there's also a part of me that wants to be single for a little while and wants to clear my mind. One issue though with ending the relationship is that my girlfriend has depression and in the past she admitted to cutting herself and wanting to end her life. She's never threatened me with that, but I'm scared to kick her out because she has no family to turn to. She just has her friend that lives 40 minutes away, but there's no telling if her friend it going to let her move in. I may just break up and tell her she can still live with me and get herself together, but knowing her she'll probably have everything packed and leave an hour after breaking the news. I just feel stuck and lost. 

td;lr   Probably going to end things with my gf because we fight all the time and I have no more energy left in the relationship",actuallesbians,1577628454,rustynails32,,1,True,2019-12-29

i've had many crushes on girls before, but i never got with one.. i downloaded tinder 5 days ago and it's been going okay, i've matched with a few girls.

i'm way too anxious and awkward tho!! i worked on my social skills over the past few years, i try not to overthink much.. and i try not to dwell on my mistakes and messages that get left on seen.

yet what if i come off as ""too much"", desperate, and pushy by attempting to flirt?? i've dealt with annoying guys before who thought they were assertive by coming off too strong, so i def know how it feels. i don't want to make any of these girls uncomfortable in any way. :&lt; 

rn the girl i'm really into suggested that she dreams of living with her future wife on an island far away and i said ""take me with you"" and she said she's up for it!!!! we sent hearts back and forth but now i'm stuck on what to respond and i don't want to scare her away by being too excited.

also there's the question if she's just being friendly bc lots of girls get on tinder to make friends. i really, really don't want to be gross, creepy and pushy.

6696,Trouble with orgasm,"Sooo, I need an advice. I'm 23(F) and I'm in a relationship with a girl three years older than me. To begin with, I have to say that we are both lesbians and had already been with other people. 
Our chemistry is amazing. I've been with a few girls before, and so has she, but we both see that this is a new level. 
We can't keep our hands of each other and feel really comfortable, but...
She comes almost every time I'm getting her off. Either orally or with fingers. Yet I seem to have some sort of blockade. When I'm really close I can't stop my mind from wondering when I come, whether I come, if she's going to be dissapointed in case I didn't. And so I ask her to stop because the pressure that's building up inside of me is just unbearable. And not in a good way obviously. 
So my question is basically what is wrong with me? We talk about sex without hesitation, and we really understand each other. The things she does to me are just what I want so the technique or communication really isn't the problem. It's something inside of me that's blocking me. Even though I reaaally like her and feel amazing when she touches me and looks at me and kisses me, I'm getting worried that the fact that I can't come might scare her off and I wouldn't want that. She's one of a kind and I believe we can build something really special. So my question is: What should I do? Has anyone had this problem?",actuallesbians,1577639488,ahinbazz,,1,True,2019-12-29

6705,"Is my friend flirting with me, or just extra?","So my friend recently broke up with her long-term boyfriend, and now she's apparently ridiculously horny. She keeps sending me texts and snaps at all hours about it, like ""so horny I'm dying""/""so wet rn"", pics of sex toys, selfies after she's slept with someone (with them sleeping next to her) and even one while she was getting dipped - and honestly it's getting pretty *weird*. Not once has any of these things happened before. 

We've never really shared details like these w/ each other, at least not to this degree, so after a while I started to get a bit annoyed and weirded out. I tried telling her that she was sharing too much, but that seemed to go right over her head. I mean, I'm not particularly interested in knowing exactly when she's about to sleep with someone, especially since they're all men.

Like initially I thought this meant that this was her way of processing the break-up, but someone suggested she might be flirting with me since she's not sharing any of this with our other friends or even her sister (who she tells everything). I didn't buy into it, but then she flat out asked me how I shave and what I prefer (in other women) before she saved, and I was just.. Caught off-guard. She's also been asking me to hang out every day lately, but never asking any of our other friends if they wanna join, which is ooc because she's super inclusive. She even said she wants to meet up for NY even though her entire family is celebrating together. 

She's told me before that she's bi, and she knows I'm bi with a preference for women (probs a lesbian, tbh), so I don't know. We've been friends for almost 9 years so this kinda feels like a sudden shift in our friendship.

I texted her this morning about a possible second date but she hasn’t seen it yet. Maybe I’m overthinking everything?

6722,"Clueless gay writing a novel, and there's a """"""sexy"""""" moment I'd like y'all to review","So the very quick plot of my novel is that Ana (MC) one day meets Eddie, a strange woman who has a spaceship and seems to come from the future. Eddie's job, since she knows about past history, is to save people from unnatural death (terrorist attacks, natural disasters...), in hope that it will somehow change the fate of Earth. I *swear* it's actually much more interesting, I'm just bad at doing summaries.

Anyway, I reached the point where Ana finally reveals what has been bothering her (the death of her girlfriend) and it leads the character to get closer, and when I say closer I mean the kind of closer without clothes (I've been building tension between these two for 60 pages). 

There are two other versions of this scene where they either simply hug or simply kiss, but this version works much better. I was wondering how did you felt reading it? It wasn't my attention at first to write such scene, but the more I wrote and the more it became necessary. I absolutely don't want to go more into details than I already did in the scene. And the end is the end of the chapter, so I'm not planning on stretching the scene any further. Thank you for your kind help!

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Ana woke up completely out of breath, both of her hand clenching the sheet. She kept hearing the screech of tires, even though she hadn’t been there when it happened. She hadn’t been there.  
&gt;  
&gt;She sat up, trying to catch her breath. She heard Eddie waking up behind. “Are you alright?” she murmured.  
&gt;  
&gt;“What didn’t you saved her?”  
&gt;  
&gt;“What?”  
&gt;  
&gt;“Isn’t it your job to save people? Why didn’t you save her?” Ana felt a rage, a rage coming from her chest and invading her entire body.  
&gt;  
&gt;“Ana what are you talking about? Save who?”  
&gt;  
&gt;Ana turned toward Eddie. “She wasn’t worth saving, is that it? You save the whole goddamn world but not her, nobody bothered saving her, why? Why didn’t you save her? Why weren’t you there? Why no one was there? Why did nobody help? Tell me… tell me… Why wasn’t I there? Why didn’t I save her?” Ana broke into tears, exhausted, feeling too many emotions at once.  
&gt;  
&gt;Carefully, slowly, Eddie approached Ana and took her in her arm, holding her thigh. “I’m so sorry.”  
&gt;  
&gt;“I want Abby to be back,” murmured Ana, having trouble breathing due to her tears.  
&gt;  
&gt;“I know, I know. I’m sorry Ana.”  
&gt;  
&gt;“It’s not fair.”  
&gt;  
&gt;“I know.” Eddie felt her own tear raising. She swallowed several times, trying to bury them down. But it was too strong, too closed from home. She started weeping, as quietly as possible.  
&gt;  
&gt;“What is it?” whispered Ana.  
&gt;  
&gt;“I lost my wife and my son five years ago,” murmured Eddie, and saying the words aloud ripped her heart apart. She felt Ana grip her tighter.  
&gt;  
&gt;They cried in each other’s arm for a long, long time. Both of their breath eventually settled and instead of letting the other go, they found their way to each other's lip. It was easy, it made sense, it felt right.  Their tears mingled with the wetness of their kiss and soon, Ana felt  Eddie’s hands gently touching places of her body that, no so long ago,  were used to someone else's hands. Ana’s hands too started moving, eager to discover this foreign body, its curve, the softness of its skin.  
&gt;  
&gt;Soon, all clothes were removed and they were laying down, as one, tightly pressed against each other, feeling the warmth, not knowing where one ended and the other begun.",actuallesbians,1577652212,Titoucap,,1,True,2019-12-29

6737,"So I’m 35, married, and still wholly unable to function around attractive women, viz:","So I work in a vintage store. We specialize in loud vintage and western wear, so we have things like cowboy boots and bolo ties in good supply. 

A friend who moved here from Toronto to be with her girl came in and brought a friend who’s visiting for Hanukkah. This friend was *smokin’ frigging hot*, like *jeezy chreezy* phew kind of hot. Actually taller than me for once, greying butch hair, and a stunning contralto speaking voice. Such a damn delight to meet her.

She wants a bolo tie, and I have to rein in my ADHD ass and not drag the entire box we have in the basement and offer them to her with grapes and crackers ffs I cannot get a grip. She picks one that looks like a cactus with a roadrunner cast in pewter and asks, “Do you think that’s a roadrunner? Like, a real one?”

“Yeah, it looks like one for sure. I love roadrunners. My grandpa got me a storybook about them when I was a kid and everything. I love them because they’re so long and they look stretchy. For birds.” Biting every surface of my tongue my teeth can reach, I kind of step back with a weird smile but I notice she’s laughing. Not at me, but actually in a delighted way. My friend’s looking at me like “u ok holy shit?”

We riff a little, I show her a belt buckle issued by the local underdog football team which she loves and decides to buy, for which I am so grateful because now I don’t have to launch into a tirade about their last season’s penalty roster and surprisingly solid d-line and yuckity yuckita. We play with the nude playing card magnets and make up some great stories about the models, like this one runs a cat rescue, this one is a retail manager and just finished a clopen Boxing Day shift, this one’s studying for the LSAT. She said one of them resembled me and I managed to simply blush (my face felt like fire) and not say anything. It was the one we all decided had just finished building the starburst clock hung behind her.

She gets to the till and I’m bursting to say it, so I do:

“Now that you have this roadrunner bolo tie, you’re gonna have to do the roadrunner thing every time you wear it.” Shutupshutupshutup. She turns her leagues-deep hazel brights on me and intones, “What roadrunner thing? Like, the noise he makes?”

Forget blessing my friend - screw her very much as she says, “Yeah, radiosupply is a great mimic - I’ll bet she can do it.” Screw. You. Friendo. May your dreidel burst into flame tonight and melt your entire stash of gelt. Butthead.

Because of course I had to do the, “meep meep!” The most delicious, rendolent, and deep laugh on this woman, land and glory,,, so of course I keep bubbling, “It’s easy, just gag your voice and open your throat to sound like Kermit the frog, then say meep meep!” Three lesbians meeping in a store is too much of a good thing, especially when one of them is dying from the toes up but still feeling her pulse press against her collar. And wedding rings.

Eh. My wife would understand, believe me. She’s a bus driver, so she loves back to school when all the grad students start boarding her bus in leggings lol. But still. How I managed to find a woman to marry me and stay is a fucking miracle if this is how I treat adorable women in my line of sight.

Moral of the story? If you feel like you’ll never find someone, you will if you want someone. I did, and I did, and I said I do, and so will you.

6748,"I’m having trouble figuring out if she’s into me. One minute I think she is, the other I think she isn’t. (16f)","There’s several things this girl I’m crushing on (15f) has done to make me think what she likes me:

    -She has given me food before without me even asking 

    -She sometimes makes excuses to touch me, and I haven’t noticed her so that to anybody else. She touches my shoulder/arm to get my attention, even touched my thigh once (not like sexually ofc). 

    -She gave me this look one time where she brushed her shoulder against mine. I really can’t forget it, but whatever it was I liked it. Maybe I’m imagining it, though.....

     -She makes origami for a lot of people, but she made one for me once and had a complicated zentangle drawing on it. She must have done it when she was at one of her club meetings, because I could tell that she might have rushed to get it done (not that it looks bad, I love it, it’s just that the said meeting was around 30 minutes or so and she might have wanted to keep it a surprise). I’ve never seen her put in so much effort in a single origami for someone else, then again I’m not around her all the time. (She said it was supposed to be a butterfly. She’s also made me a small squirel and a dog).

     -Most often times when I’m in the halls walking to my next class and whatnot, she almost always says hi to me and calls me by name, or she’ll say “hey, you!” (Which I really like, I think, for some reason). 

      -There was this time where our thighs were touching while we were sitting together (again not sexually) but she didn’t move away. At that same time while someone sitting by us was being annoying she told me that I could scoot the other way and that she’d go with me. While I was moving her thigh was still touching mine. 

     -I know this is sorta dumb but she has a pixie cut and she’s sorta giving me the lesbian vibes
 
     -There’s multiple lgbt people in our friend group 

     -At around homecoming she mentioned that she’d reject any guy who would ask her, if any dude asked her. However, I don’t remember her saying she didn’t want to go to homecoming, and she didn’t mention anything about turning down girls either. 

     -She asks me questions irl to get to know me better and such. 


But these are things that happened that makes me think she doesn’t like me in the way I hope she does, and is just being friendly:

     -Another friend of mine (who I’ll call Bob (not his real name) for privacy’s sake) whom I thought was gay (but he’s actually bi with a preference to men) sometimes puts his arm around her. But to me it doesn’t particularly seem in a couple-y sort of way, more like a friendly sort of way, yknow? But my crush never seems to reciprocate, sometimes she lifts his arm off herself.
      -Bob’s sister this one time said my crush and Bob were cute, although she never actually said they were dating, and she never said “cute together” either, she just said “cute”. And maybe they aren’t actually dating, maybe she meant it in the sense that they would be cute together if they were to date. 
      -Another time while I was walking around with my crush and Bob, Bob sort of awkwardly held her wrist. Not her hand though. She didn’t reciprocate and she kept her hands in her pockets, and if I remember right she even nudged him away. This happened twice in the same day, each time with the same outcome. 
     -There was one time they (my crush and Bob) talked about hanging out in front of me without even inviting me. Bob started it though. 
     -She takes a long time to respond to texts. But when she does, she seems excited to speak to me, I think? Now, keep in mind she doesn’t have a phone, only an iPad mini, which means she doesn’t have data on it I’m pretty sure. Also, I have no idea how strict her parents are (like if they take it away for periods during the day or if she only gets it under certain circumstances or if it has parental controls on it). 

As a side note, this Bob guy and my crushes family have been friends for a long time, like a really long time, so obviously they’d be close as friends. Also, I’m pretty sure this dude is a legal adult, or close to it, so I’m not so sure if he’d date a minor. 

She’s never actually told me what her sexuality is straight up. To be fair I haven’t told her directly but I’ve talked about being lesbian to other friends outside of my friend group when she was within earshot. 

Do you all think she likes me? Should I go for it? If I should go for it, what should I even say? Tips? Any feedback is appreciated.

(I’m afraid of ruining our friendship, that and my friendship with her friends. It’s been going pretty well and I have a tough time over losing people, and in addition I have an extremely difficult time making any new friends in the first place.

I had loved one girl unrequitedly before her for many years and was disappointed, and she once told me she'd liked a guy in her high school, but they never dated and she didn't love him that much. 

So let's call her Jane, well, me and Jane had a same circle of friends and around a year ago we slowly started hanging out more and more alone together, mostly due to my initiative because I realised she was funny and interesting. We discovered we had a lot in common, she kept saying we were the same person, and we sometimes argued jokingly about many things and she started playfully hitting me when I annoyed her. 
Other friends started saying we looked like a married couple and I think it was funny for her too, she didn't mind. 

And then I guess somehow along the way I'd started liking her and thinking more and more about her. She also never talked about boys and looked like a lesbian to me (I know, sterotypes, but no makeup, sitting like a guy etc...) 
And she seemed curious if I was a lesbian at the beginning, but since I am pretty shy myself I avoided the topic but slowly started hinting that I liked her and flirting a bit, touching her more, joking that we'd get married and so on, and she didn't mind, except she told me she won't ever marry anyone lol. 

So not to go into that many details, with time she started making flirty jokes herself, when we fought, she said many times that we needed to go see a couple's therapist and saying that our friendship was special or different. But she also stayed mostly cold when it came to physical contact, it was just me holding her arm and so on, she just playfully hit me when i annoyed her and that was cute I guess, or at the beginning she would sometimes poke my leg with her leg under the table sometimes. 

Otherwise it's important to say that she is generally a very closed off, emotionally unavailable person and she generally avoids hugs and similar from everyone, but she didn't mind it either. 

But then a few months into all of that I asked her to define we were, and she jokingly avoided it for days saying it wasn't possible to define it, and then just said we were friends when I pressed her one day. I felt so disappointed, and she could see it and asked me if I thought differently. But cuz I didn't want to get rejected again (had bad luck in the past),  I said - of course, I agree, we are friends, what else could we be... 

Now, of course, I see it was my mistake for not being open or saying what I thought or wanted from the beginning, but as I've said I'm shy and I didn't feel better after confessing in the past to the other girl. 

And at that point Jane was suspicious and laughed and said that she didn't believe me because I was telling her how I talked about her to some other friend, not to explain but yeah... Which hurt me even more, because why would she then lead me on if she had known I liked her and then why would she even laugh?.. 

So at that point I felt angry and didn't want to talk about it, I told her we needed to stop being friends. 

However, we reconciled after a week lol when she texted me to give me back a book.

And then I guess everything was fine for a while because we were happy just cuz we got hang out again and we eventually started texting every day, sending each other cute romantic gifs and she even sent me a screenshot of some cute picture with a heart for the Valentine's day. 

I started thinking again that maybe she did like me, but maybe her ego was too big or she was shy, or she didn't wanna talk about it either... 

She still was cold when it came to physical contact , I only hugged her sometimes or touched her arm, held it etc... And she didn't mind, it was so weird, I even asked her almost every time if she minded, because she is really passive.. 

But then after more time had passed I saw it wasn't going anywhere as we hadn't even kissed and I kinda knew it wasn't going to happen, let alone something more, but I let it continue in order not to feel heartbroken again. I felt I somehow didn't want to know and I wanted to live in ignorant bliss as long as I could.. And i just couldn't make myself talk to her about it because i kinda expected I would get rejected and also I thought it was unfair that she always expected me to talk about myself and reveal secrets or whatever, while she stayed closed-off and not ready to talk about her personal matters or emotions. 

I got more and more confused, started thinking that I was a loser again being led on, or that I imagined the whole thing, but then I thought all of that flirting, we even celebrated the anniversary of our ""friendship"" and bought each other gifts sometimes (I did it more though), sending each other hearts.. 
Like damn, if she had suspected I really did have feelings for her (like it was obvious, we sometimes even jokingly talked about guys and I always told her I loved her more than them, and she even told me similar sometimes), why would she continue flirting if she didnt feel the same? 

And then I guess more and more problems started occurring because I like to solve a problem immediately and argue and say what bothers me right away, while she can be passive aggressive and she clams up when there is any argument, also I guess I was getting annoyed about being unable to let her go and yet not being in a relationship with her.  She didn't even want to hug me, let alone something else (she doesn't like doing it with anyone else either). She also never explained to me why, she usually just says she is like that and she is happy just to spend time with me. 

But yeah, arguments weren't being solved and i was getting frustrated all of my effort wasn't getting me anywhere (I know I should have talked about it earlier, but a combination of me being shy and having bad past experiences and her just seeming judgemental sometimes and expecting me to say everything and for her just to be there passively). She also started kind of taking me for granted, and we both became bitter towards each other, so a few weeks ago we ended our friendship and now we don't talk at all. I was also depressed and negative because my dad died a few years ago and so on, I guess we just weren't compatible as she said..

Now after all of this I regret everything so much, I wish I had never started liking her or even touched her, I just started thinking that she is probably asexual and maybe just liked the attention, I even felt I crossed her boundaries by hugging her or touching her even though she said she didn't mind and even sometimes playfully hit me/hugged my arm herself. And idk she just stayed so vague, it could have been anything.. Once I asked her if she was asexual and she said she didn't know, and avoided that topic, other time I said she probably was because she never likes anyone she passively agreed or just didn't say anything. 

But yeah, I can't believe how this could happen to me, like why would she then send me romantic gifs, hearts, want to celebrate anniversary, find it fun when I was jealous of her texting her foreign best friend every day, etc... 

And why was I so dumb and weak again ignoring all the signs it wasn't going to work.. And now I feel I wasted my time again, and I'm even scared we would reconcile because we had so much in common and we loved texting each other, had a lot of inside jokes etc.. But I know it would lead nowhere again and I shouldn't do it. 

I can't even understand what exactly happened? How should I proceed and stop overthinking this? Never contact her again? Thanks in advance!

TL;DR I thought we were going to be in a relationship and she liked me romantically, turns out I was just reading into it or something, feeling confused, maybe she is asexual",actuallesbians,1577670252,Villanueva_Mae,,1,True,2019-12-29

6771,I just don’t know where to find lesbian friends my age,"I know this gets asked a lot but I’ve tried everything and I’m really starting to feel depressed and lonely about it. 

I’m a 27 year old lesbian and just can’t find any women my age to be friends with. I go to lgbt+ groups/hangouts that I find on sites like meetup or the big lesbian forum we have in my country, but I’m always the youngest one by at least 10 years. 

I tried going to lgbt+ groups that were more political or supportive and not set in bars, but the people my age are mostly non binary and pan, and the few lesbians are always much older than me and seem totally uninterested in making new friends, they come as a group and only talk to each other about stuff no one else gets when they’re not their friends.
In the beginning I tried to make friends with them, but it felt like they were looking down on me or at least not taking me seriously and I stopped trying. 

I made other friends there but none of them identifies as a woman and they’re all pansexual and while it’s nice to finally have some lgbt+ friends at all, I just really wish I had lesbian friends. 

I tried using apps like tinder and okcupid to make friends but I had no success at all. I try my best to be very upfront about it but I feel like most women agree while thinking that this is a way of getting closer before dating. 

Where I live (not in the US), OKcupid is considered the ~edgy alternative~ and smaller hipper version to/of tinder. It’s filled with people who live freely but it’s also a very tumblr-esque dating platform. The majority of people my age on that app have very colorful hair and ten piercings in their face alone and there’s always a statement about how this is problematic and that is toxic and while I’m all for being loud and politically active, it’s genuinely tiring on that app. It’s like a competition about who the wokest person is.

So since that didn’t work, I gathered up the courage to go to the ONE lesbian bar in my town. It’s more of a pub and it’s filled with lesbians which is really cool but all of them were my parents age. The general atmosphere was nice but I felt really out of place. 

I went to EVERY SINGLE lgbt+ college party I found this year and it was super nice and heart warming. The crowd usually consists of mostly gay guys (like 90%, all ages) but there were always some baby lesbians that were adorable and I was really impressed by their confidence (I was in the darkest back of the closet when I was their age) but just like karma works, at those parties I was the old one of course and the longest interaction I’ve had was with a 18 year old who showed me pictures of her girlfriend on her phone who wasn’t there that night and who she missed. My friends are refusing to go to anymore of those partys with me which I get because they’re very badly organized and boring and mostly used by people to get drunk before they go to their gay clubs. 

And that’s it’s. What annoys me is that we actually have a pretty big gay scene in town but it’s only for mlm. I found some party invitations that said females were allowed but the clubs are obviously for gay men and I just doubt I’d meet young lesbians there. Am I wrong about that? (Please say I am and that you’ve found your very best lesbian friend at a party called ~sexy leather daddies~)

I know I could always try to join a womens soccer team or start playing softball but I’m afraid of balls (haha.) and not interested in sports at all. 

Please help me out. I love connecting to y’all online but it’s just not the same. I need lesbian friends in my life. My already existing friends are cool, don’t get me wrong but it’s just not the same.

The only lesbians I know are my ex girlfriend and other women I’ve dated. They didn’t have any lesbian friends either except for the ones they stayed in touch with after dating.

Lately I’ve been very afraid that this is just how it is and I’ll never have a group of friends I can relate to. I’ve thought about moving away just to enter a new, bigger wlw scene and will definitely do it as soon as I can, but I can’t leave this town for another three years.",actuallesbians,1577672063,ineedlesbianfriends,,1,True,2019-12-29

6773,Hopeful romantic looking for someone to get to know through letter writing...,"\*if this is not the right place for this, please let me know and I will take it down\*

Hello there! Ever since I was little, I have wanted to find someone to be my penpal; now that I have a few, I realize that I want to write to someone who genuinely wants to get to know me. Texting is great and all, but I like to slow down and write what I want to say in my own writing (and in fun colored pens). Writing sappy notes to people I have dated in the past has been one of my favorite ways to show that I care, but I have yet to find someone who thinks they are just as special as I do. 

Some info about me:

\- I'm 18 ;) (looking for someone around my age, preferably 18+)

\- I'm from the USA and want to find someone from here as well

\- Senior in high school and plan on studying psychology in college

\- Heavily involved in volunteer activities in and around my school and community

\- Closeted to my family but out to all of my friends

\- Love to read, crochet, craft in every sense of the word, and spend time outdoors

\- Sagittarius :)

Want to make an impression when you slide into my messages? Tell me a joke, a cheesy pickup line: I'm a sucker for someone that can make me laugh. Message me and we don't \*click\*? No biggie! I would love to have some more LGBT+ friends. If you made it all the way through my wordy post, you must have done it for a reason ;)",actuallesbians,1577672788,what_is_life_213,,1,True,2019-12-29

6793,Calling parents of girls- any negative reactions in your relationship with your daughter when dating same sex partner?,"Hi friends- 

TL;DR: I divorced a dude, started dating a woman, and my 7 year old daughter is creeped out by me. Ever had this happen??

I've recently divorced my husband, with whom I have two kids- one boy, one girl. I left him and began a relationship with a butch woman with whom I was set up by friends and I have fallen totally in love. My husband and kids have always known about my queer identification, so my husband and son were not surprised by my GF's presence. However, my daughter is 7 years old and probably didn't understand sexual orientation before I left the marriage. Which would be expected at her developmental stage.

My concern at this point is that she has been open about ""feeling icky"" around me. She states she ""doesn't know why"" and ""doesn't know what to do with it"". She has shown me what she feels like (for example) by physically rolling away from me if I'm lying next to her (""It's like I want to do this when you're around""). She talks to me about it in a very sincere way and we have developed a plan for me to ask if hugs and kisses are okay before just assuming that I can plant one on her cheek. 

Have other parents experienced anything like this when there has been an open change in sexual orientation/understanding with kids? I'm not convinced that my change in partners is the sole cause of her change in feelings toward me, but I'm exploring it here nonetheless. (other research has shown that kids who feel scared/unsafe are likely to become less affectionate, so I am exploring whether my leaving the household altogether might be the source of the problem.)

6804,I almost had a date...,"I met this girl and Bumble and we planned to have lunch/coffee in la. I thought “yes!  this girl hasn’t ghosted me and wants to go out” then the following day I see she’s read my message but didn’t respond. She left her read messages on for the first time. So I guess she ghosted me. I sent a follow up message just to check and yeah she ghosted me.

6805,"How do I make sure I'm not using her for validation? Am I selfish, or just empathetic?","I really like someone who's in a very vulnerable place in her life right now. We're becoming closer friends, and she's gotten comfortable enough to lean on me for emotional support, and she's starting to open up to me about past traumas she's currently working through. 

In the past, I've overextended myself with friends who need my emotional support. I've been in friendships where the other person has become very dependent on me to the point where it hurts them and me. I let it happen, because it felt good to feel trusted and needed. I don't want to do that again. 

I'm worried that, what if I'm attracted to this person because I feel like she needs someone-- because I gravitate towards people who I feel like I can ""save"" or ""fix?"" Even though I know I can't save or fix people. Or maybe it's just my impulse to try to help her because I already like her as a person. I'm not sure whether I'm fulfilling a selfish need-- my need to be wanted, my need to feel useful, my need to be appreciated-- or whether I'm a good person who just feels bad because my friend feels bad. This might be completely baseless self-deprecating nonsense, but what if it's not?

Like, I don't want to use anyone. And I don't want my relationship with her-- platonic or otherwise-- to be based in pity, or selfishness, or in me taking advantage of her vulnerability. I guess I think about how easy it would be to use her, to make her depend on me, to make her date me just so I won't leave her-- I'd never do that. But it would be easy. It would be easy to do it even accidentally. 

It makes me feel like maybe I just shouldn't bring up my romantic feelings. Even if she completely rejects me, I wanna be her friend and be in her life-- but I don't know if she's in a place to risk that right now. I'm afraid she'd just say yes so that I'd stick around. But it's also completely possible that I'm projecting my experience with a past friend onto her. Maybe I'm projecting my fears and bad experiences onto her, and maybe it's best if I'm honest about wanting to date her.

I just really want to make her happy. But I'm afraid that, maybe, making her happy is... me using her to validate myself? Or maybe I'm just reacting normally to someone's sad backstory, and I'm not being selfish, and I'm just drowning myself in negative talk? I can't tell if I'm being manipulative, or if I'm being a good friend. Maybe I'm just so used to feeling guilty that I'm looking for something bad to fixate on when I feel good. 

I don't think I should date her right now. Even though I like her and I'm pretty sure she likes me back. But... is that dumb, too? If we like each other, shouldn't we date? Is it wrong to hold off because I'm afraid that she needs a platonic friend who will be there forever, more than a girlfriend who might break up with her? Is it wrong to be more concerned about the hypothetical long-term fragility of her feelings than about the chemistry we have right now, in the moment?

I just want everything right now. I want to kiss her, I want to fix her, I want to be her friend and watch her grow, I want to know everything about her, I want to date her, I want to keep my distance, I want to never hurt her, I want to be careful, I want to be reckless. I don't know how to be responsible, I don't know how to be what she needs me to be without ONLY being what she needs from me. You know? 

Maybe I'm overthinking everything and I should just be honest. She's not a houseplant, after all-- she has a brain, she's taken care of herself so far, she has all kinds of layers that I don't even know about yet, and she has agency. Maybe I should just trust that she knows what she wants, and that I know what I want, and not worry about taking care of her so much as just like, being there with her. As myself, as another person.

I dunno, guys. Help me figure myself out here, because I don't know if I'm good or bad here or what. :(",actuallesbians,1577690130,Unfey,,1,True,2019-12-30

6811,Just needed somewhere to express my fears/concerns/questions about attraction,"I’m really struggling here trying to figure how much of my so-called attraction to men is a byproduct of compulsory heterosexuality. This really is an issue for me when deciding which terminology to use to refer to myself. I usually go with “queer” or say “hey, labels don’t matter.” But for some reason, I really wish I could finally make a definitive statement.

You see, I’ve never had that “a-ha” moment. The moment people describe when they know they’re gay. Everything seems so... unclear for me.

Ever since I went to a (historically) women’s college, I am able to explore my long-held attractions to women and non binary folk. Before then I had only dated/been with men, and all of it was just... fine. I never had the brain melting feelings of attraction, romantic or sexual, just kind of dull feelings if any. But with everyone else... it’s a whole different story. I had the most mind blowing infatuation with this one person at my college and it totally was unlike anything I’d ever felt before with any man, and it made me question my understanding of romantic attraction in general. I had never been so eager to kiss someone, to hold them in my arms, to listen to them talk about ever single detail of their mundane day, or feel their arm around my shoulder as we watch a movie together. It was wholly different. In retrospect, was I ever actually attracted to men? Am I just repressed due to internalized homophobia and fear?

In a lot of ways I think I continue to date men out of fear. Fear of making a definitive statement (mostly to my parents), even though I know that sexuality can be fluid. I don’t want to tell them one thing, which is hard enough, and then have to tell them another thing. I wish I knew what to tell them. I don’t understand where the line between platonic and romantic is drawn.

I don’t know. Thanks for reading.",actuallesbians,1577695118,filialpryety,,1,True,2019-12-30

So we started talking and after just a few days she mentioned that she wanted to send me a secret santa card that the school was hosting and it was out of the blue, but unfortunately she couldn’t and neither could i so we came to the agreement that we do it ourselves. I said that i would give her a gift and she said the same. So we come to the day where we exchange the gifts and during that period we talked all day, she didn’t reply fast which she still does but I don’t mind really since she does this to all of her friends (she doesn’t check her phone much). So we talk in insta dms, at first we only texted but then switched to photos (like snaps) and most of the time she sends her whole face so that might be a good sign??? Since now it’s winter break i want to get her out sometime and i want to know if she has the same feelings as me. Of course I can’t straight up ask her neither I can’t tell her that im bi because of the stigma around us(shitty country) but i really need your advice and I’d answer any questions you have.

6855,Advice needed about the next steps,"Hey everyone,

I’m in need of advice and I have no clue what to do next.

My gf (F24) and I (F25), have been together for 2 years now. I am not a sexual person and don’t crave sex all the time. I asked my gf if she would be okay if we went through the relationship without any sexual intimacy whatsoever (we obviously did it whenever I was feeling it but maybe about twice or 3 times a month at most) and she was completely understanding. Mind you, the reason why I felt less intimate with her was because she had cheated on me with a male a few months ago (yes a shitshow story I know). 

Anyway, I forgave her from that incident and just didn’t want to be intimate in general. We’re currently on a trip and I found out that she had been watching porn late nights or whenever she’d use the bathroom. It triggered me even more after finding out she was watching male on female vids and it also hurt me that she lied straight to my face countless times after saying she wouldn’t do so.

6864,Haunted by my ex,"This is mostly just a venting post since I need to scream into an anonymous void right now. 

So, my ex and I broke up three weeks ago after five years together since she cheated on me. I’ve since broke up with her, moved the hell out, and started going through my breakup rituals to try and cope with the sinking feeling of betrayal. It’s crushed me and I’ve been coping unhealthily since (Tinder hookups, spending all my time at the gym or work, drinking more than I should). But, I am coming to terms with everything and the hollow feeling in my chest gets less and less noticeable. 

Well, we had already planned and paid for a trip overseas to celebrate our anniversary that would start two weeks from now. We both paid a pretty considerable amount in non-refundable tickets to attractions, plane tickets, and accommodations. I was still planning on using my plane tickets and the accommodations (still in my name) as kind of a grief tour to try and define my life without her in it. Well, my ex had just let me know that she will be using her plane ticket to go as well but will be staying in local hostels during the trip. I quickly changed my seat to the other side of the plane but the thought of being on four different planes with her and in the cities at the same time makes me sick. It was implied that she will be using OUR attraction tickets with someone else and I’m cycling back through the same feelings I had when I found out. Like, how can she be taking someone else on OUR anniversary trip? She is still sending me daily messages asking for me to speak with her and she is bringing someone else?! 

I keep telling myself that says more about her than it does me but I feel so empty realizing I meant so little to her. I thought I was going to spend the rest of my life with her and now I’m having to redefine my future. 

I had been flexible about kids because she wanted them so bad, we had even been looking into adoption agencies. I had been looking into quitting my job and doing my side business full time. I had saved up a down payment on a larger house and we had been looking to upsize in spring. All of this is totally out the window since the one person I considered my life partner had apparently been sleeping around for the past two years.

6877,Calling queer theory enthusiasts (nsfw),"CW: BDSM themes, nonconsent

Hi ladies and theydies. I’ve been turning something over in my mind recently and I’m wondering if y’all would have some insight. I’m very femme, so the majority of girls who are attracted to me are butch/stone butch, although I’m attracted to lots of different women. I like to think I am respectful and affirming toward butch women and the way they feel most comfortable presenting themselves. However, I have this recurring sexual fantasy of feminizing a butch, either by emphasizing her femininity or forcing feminity on her by fucking her with a strap or even watching a man fuck her (always doggy style-which I feel is important because it’s a particularly submissive position) and seeing her enjoy it in spite of herself. I’m a late bloomer lesbian and I wonder if this is a manifestation of internalized homophobia (and the satisfaction comes in “fixing” her) or if it’s a purely sadistic fantasy (in the bdsm sense). I also have a history of being sexually assaulted/raped by men, and for a time I used sadomasochism to repeat that trauma as a form of self harm or a shitty processing technique. So I wonder if my psyche is trying to interpret that trauma now by forcing it on to someone else. I would never bring up these fantasies to a partner (I have a butch girlfriend now, who does actually seem to be submissive) because they feel inappropriate, and because sadism is not something I want to extend towards my girlfriend, whom I love. 

TLDR: Do I want to feminize butch women because of internalized homophobia or because I have sadistic tendencies?",actuallesbians,1577737000,myblueoctober,,1,True,2019-12-30

I’m currently dating a girl, have been for almost a year and a half. She’s new to the gay community whereas I’m a bit of a veteran. 

When it comes to terminology we use it in a playful sense, particularly when it comes to the usual phrases: top, bottom, switch, butch, fem and so forth. However one that got me stumped - Gal Pal? The phrase originated from and blew up on this sub a few months ago, of course it naturally made its way into our teasing vocabulary. 

Is Gal Pal the new word for girlfriends or secret girlfriends? If we are dating exclusively and both of us have said I love you - are we girlfriends? I mean, I’m somewhat under the impression that we are but neither of us have explicitly said it, it’s more an agreed assumption I suppose.

She’s very dominant and is turned on by her partner being turned on so me not being able to come was frustrating for the both of us. We’ll be together tomorrow night and I’m worried the same thing will happen. 
I don’t think it’s a comfort issue because I seriously could not be more comfortable around her.

6898,First day in our new apartment and the lesbian couple in the apartment downstairs has invited us to a New Years Eve party,"My girlfriend and I have just moved in to our own place together. It is a really cute apartment on the third floor that has a balcony facing a river. Sounds ideal (and for the price it’s a steal). Sadly we have had a lot of trouble with the apartment already. 

Amongst other things, we were wrongfully charged phone service along with the internet we requested. After hell of transfer after transfer on the phone, I just decided to go in to the Spectrum store to fix the issue entirely. 

While I was waiting I saw an obviously queer spectrum employee walk in to work. Not only did she look like a classic butch but she had a rainbow lanyard hanging from her pocket. It always feels good to see another gay person around. Safer. 

As I’m giving my address to the man helping me, the butch pipes up and says, “Did you say (our address)?” When I said yes she told me she lived in the apartment almost below us. Now I am also very butch and so obviously gender non-conforming that in my previous job I was consistently called sir. I did not need to say to her “I like your lanyard” when she walked by to indicate that yes, me me big gay too. But I did anyways because solidarity. 

I texted my girlfriend about the interaction and she mentioned seeing what she thought were two lesbians (or two not straight women) carrying in groceries together. We knew it had to be the same one from spectrum. 

A few hours pass that day and I hear a knock at the front door. The spectrum gays girlfriend is at my door looking shy but excited. She said that her girlfriend mentioned me and they wanted to invite me to their New Year’s Eve get together in their apartment. I told her I’d tell my girlfriend and she got excited and even asked me my girlfriends name.

My girlfriend and I are not extremely sociable people but we feel so welcomed now that we know two gay women live in the same complex as us and were brave enough to come to our door and invite us over. 

We are nervous! We probably won’t stay for more than one hour because we’re gay and introverted and want to spend our first New Years together after a LDR kept us apart last year. 

The best part is... they look just like us. Ones butch with the shaved sides and ones got long brown hair.

When I was 19, I told a kid I worked with and he said ""so do you think Regina is hot?"" When Regina was walking to us, I was so caught off guard I bluntly said ""no"".

Before the wedding I decided to look up the brides because I had never met them prior to the wedding. Turns out the bestfriend was marrying  someone who looks a lot like my girlfriend and coincidently has the same name as my girlfriend's middle name.

I met the couple and they were absolutely in love and really nice. However, when my GF's bestfriend's  father started to give a speech, the way my girlfriend was staring at her bestfriend did not sit right with me. Not because I was jealous of their friendship but I got the feeling there was something there.

We have been in a long distance relationship for 2+ years and she has never mentioned anything other than a platonic relationship between them. In order to relieve myself of the anxiety I had belt up, I decided to ask her about it. She then mentioned to me that in fact, she had asked her out and she did not indicate to me clearly what followed after, attributing it to the fact that she had forgotten the details. Mind you, she NEVER forgets anything. 

My girlfriend and her bestfriend have not  always been on good terms. They did not speak to each other almost the whole time we have been dating. They only started speaking a few weeks leading up to her bestfriend's wedding. I was glad that they rekindled the friendship. Nonetheless, since then she has been very critical of me. Suddenly, it seems that I am always doing something wrong or not inadequate. I'd like to think that this has nothing to do with the friendship and I am not just doing my part in the relationship.

Then I finally started dating women and first the sex was AMAZING but then I seemed to have lost my entire sex drive, felt guilty 24/7 because the girl I was with back then wanted sex way more than me which until then was always something that happened to me, figured out that it Probably came from some internalized homophobia. worked on it, feel a lot better about being a lesbian now. 

but now!!! I can’t!! Stop!! Thinking about girls!!! I feel like I’m a teen again and just found out about masturbation. I really really hope that I’m right when I say that I’m not coming off creepy in public but I have to be so careful to not desperately fall in love with every woman I see. I zone out and stare at butts in front of me on the elevator. I zone out and realize that I’ve been thinking about sex during the entire meeting. I have to actively close the app and put my phone away to stop myself from commenting on pictures on the lesbian selfie subs like I’m a weird old guy on the straight gonewild subs.

I try to make lesbian friends because that’s important right?? I need friends??? I want friends??? And I sign up for events and scroll trough all the profile pictures and think that every single one is the cutest person I’ve ever seen. I tried using dating apps to find people to hang out with but I can’t stop thinking about how much I’d like to have sex with them!! What!!! The fuck!!! 

The only girls that seem to want casual hookups are younger than me and that’s also something I’m VERY ashamed about because I KNOW it’s not cool to have sex with a 19 year old, its CREEPY and A few weeks ago I would have barfed if someone even suggested that but now I’m on tinder looking at girls with snapbacks and long hair and the whole skater cool girl fuckboi stick which is what I was DEADLY attracted to and felt really guilty about when I was their age (I had a boyfriend. I was straight. A very straight, boyfriend having ally that was not in love with all of her friends, thank you very much!) and even though I know I wouldn’t make out with them or feel like that if I really saw them I WANT to make out with them. I usually don’t even date people two years younger than me. 

Also no one above 23 seems to want to hookup anyway. The girls I’ve talked to lately all started with “I’m not dating to have fun, I’m dating to find love...” which I GET and my ex girlfriend and me also started like that but now I’m going trough puberty and I just want to make out with girls and kiss girls and have sex with them 24/7. And there’s no Grindr for lesbians??? Why!!! Is there!! No grindr for lesbians! (I know why, it’s because of men that don’t respect boundaries, but like, I still want to scream it into the void.) 

And yeah I will not put “I JUST WANNA HAVE SEX” on my okcupid or tinder profile because that’s way too public and the wlw scene in this town is too
Damn small To ruin my image before I even really was a part of it. There’s also no lesbian bar, and the next party for lesbians that’s not just “gays + friends (females welcome)” is during pride. But I JUST WANNA HAVE SEX",actuallesbians,1577753841,throwawayooo4,,1,True,2019-12-30
6916,I got a gf!!!,"I always love reading when people post they got a girlfriend so I’m gonna do one too ☺️

I have only this year come to terms with my attraction to girls, and having had a long hard think about it I’m pretty sure I’m not attracted to guys either (not been with either but when I actually think about it I can only see myself enjoying being intimate with a girl). 

I’m not out to my parents or any of my family (which she knows and said isn’t an issue for her atm) which is so so lovely of her because I feel shit about it and I think it’s why I’m stopping myself from feeling elated about this. I do feel elated but also I’m still trying to process it all (first relationship ever - I’m 18 - so all of its new to me). I think it might also be I pictured this growing up that I’d get a boyfriend and it feels like this big thing to get a boyfriend!! So because I never really thought about it as a girlfriend, maybe that’s why?? I can’t think of anything else because I like her so much and the last kiss we had before I had to leave tonight gave me butterflies 🥰

Now I haven’t heard from her since then and I am flying to Hawaii next week for ten days to visit her.  I just sent a message saying this:

 “I don’t blame you for not really wanting to talk to me, I’m sure you’re busy and all as well but I do think we need talk at some point since I’m coming there in a week.

Then I’m all full part of the rainbow alliance/brigade. I felt it was a bigger more important deal coming out to myself. It took a long time coming and accepting it. I grew up extremely repressed and conservative. Having a lesbian love life was far away from what I was shown as ideal or what I even thought possible. And when I did realize it I was like “ok, women are people. The most loved people. Therefore, I have more right than anybody!” 😂🤣 In all seriousness though. I felt like it was important for my family to know how important and valuable this was to me. So I stood my ground. I don’t regret it. Not yet. I do feel a teeny tinge guilty. But I’ve never made excuses to anyone but myself for being a lesbian. Sometimes I feel like an asshole for not giving my families opinions of my love life more worth.

6942,ahhhh i feel bad and am confused,"i guess i am dating two girls right now? not sure if ""dating"" is the right word... one of them is a very chill FWB, we met at a bar and hooked up soon after, have been hanging out and hooking up for about three months, i'm extremely fond of her but neither of us want to be in a relationship with each other, we talk about the other people we're dating/hooking up with, it's working great and makes me happy! but i can't see myself really being with her, i figure we'll shift to being platonic friends if either of us gets into a relationship. with the other girl (will call her Q), things are a lot more emotionally intense? when i first met her six months ago, i fell for her hard and fast, and i fantasized about her being my girlfriend... but she'd just left her boyfriend of three years to come out as gay, is still not out to her family, and has a shit-ton of internalized homophobia, so she behaved in ways that were inconsistent and sometimes really upsetting. because of that, i cooled off, took a break from her, and met the FWB, but Q and i reconnected in october and it feels like we're dating now? we go out once or twice a week to dinner or drinks and make out a bunch and tell each other intense things about our lives. is that dating? with her there's a lot that drives me crazy, and i've definitely reconsidered whether i want her to ever be my girlfriend, but we have a lot of chemistry and emotional intensity that i'm into, so...it's also a thing...i am kind of overwhelmed by all this?

anyyyyway i feel bad because i had new years' plans with a bunch of people that i changed sort of last minute...i was planning to go with my friends to a queer event, Q was gonna hang with her friends, we talked about touching base later in the night but nothing was set in stone. THEN i realized that i'm totally broke and can't afford to do what i was planning, so i talked to my housemate, and he suggested we just host a low-key party with some of his coworkers and whoever i wanted to invite...and since i didn't have fixed plans with Q, i wasn't sure if i could count on seeing her, so i asked my FWB what she was doing and she said she wants to come. THEN Q texted me a bit later asking about NYE, so i just told her i was staying home, and she seemed really disappointed? so i'm like, wtf, are we dating or not, is it actually important to you to spend NYE with me or did your other plans just fall through? also i was evasive in not mentioning the party and the FWB which i now regret and don't exactly understand... it's confusing AF because i feel like Q seeks a lot of emotional intimacy from me and doesn't like that i'm seeing the FWB, but she also doesn't want to be in a relationship with me--mainly, i think, because she's working through some past trauma and the aforementioned shit ton of internalized homophobia. but the levels of emotional intimacy with her make it \*feel\* more like a relationship than my FWB, so i feel guilty at the thought of her winding up alone on NYE, but that feels unfair because...she literally said she doesn't want to be my girlfriend...and so i stopped wanting her to be, and weirdly started enjoying non-monogamy, which i never thought i would...and i think it'd be a blast to have my FWB at this party, she's cute and fun and might drag me off to fuck at some point. so why do i feel guilty? what do i dooooo?

But, there's just this crushing sense of loneliness and depression. I'm going out and doing what I'd normally do. Meeting up to play board games. 

Going to spend new years eve in bed not doing anything in particular just being sad and lonely. 

I feel bleh.  My therapist and everyone else says I need to distract myself, but there's only so many video games, tv shows, toys, books/comics etc that I can engage with/in before I'm just back to square on.

I'm on all the apps atm, and that just makes the loneliness worse. Just trying to find queerdo femmes in my area to watch terrible movies and make out with, but I hadn't had any luck of that. 

And I feel that my friends both old and new are tired of me talking about how sad I've been these past couple days. I just want to bottle it all up or just not feel. 

Or just to stop existing 

Not to be pretentious or sound like a dumb angsty teen or whatever I've just been focused so hard on this passage from the essay ""The Vanity of Existence""

""In a world where all is unstable, and nought can endure, but is swept onwards at once in the hurrying whirlpool of change; where a man, if he is to keep erect at all, must always be advancing and moving, like an acrobat on a rope--in such a world, happiness is inconceivable. How can it dwell where, as Plato says, continual Becoming and never Being is the sole form of existence? In the first place, a man never is happy, but spends his whole life in striving after something which he thinks will make him so; he seldom attains his goal, and when he does, it is only to be disappointed; he is mostly shipwrecked in the end, and comes into harbor with masts and rigging gone. And then, it is all one whether he has been happy or miserable; for his life was never anything more than a present moment always vanishing; and now it is over.""

While we were both drunk, we started kissing. She stopped and asked me if I wanted to touch her boobs. I can’t remember if I said anything but I froze. Suddenly her boobs were out. She had been stressed the past couple of weeks, and although she doesn’t talk about it I can tell she had been feeling depressed. I felt bad because I didn’t want to make her feel bad so I grabbed her boobs. She put her boobs away and then we continued to kiss. The rest of the night was fine, but the next day I did feel very bad and cried a lot. I don’t really know why. It could be because I was ashamed of what I had done or that I let it happen or confused as to why she asked me if I wanted to touch her. This has really been bugging me and I don’t know how to move on from this.

A couple years into our relationship he came out as trans. I figured since i love him and hed be happier id be able to handle it. But as times gone on and ive seen how much hes changed and what a man he is now, i can't say that I'm anywhere near as attracted to him. I cant even see him as anything but a guy and i feel bad for this but the other day i was looking at him and trying to see any resemblance of who was once my girlfriend, but i couldnt find her. He really just is a dude now and thats all i can see him as. Which is a good thing. It's great for him. And im happy he's becoming happier with himself. 

But i want a girlfriend. I had a crush for 4 years before we were actually together and i already loved him. I still love him. But i miss the company and intimacy and emotional connection (emotionally hes def changed since being on T) of a woman.

6964,i miss her all the time and i wish i could stop,"ok i probably should have made an alt bc the girl this is abt knows my username hahaahahahahahahha imsorry

tldr i miss my ex gf + best friend and heres a list of reasons why

for context, we were in a long distance relationship and we’ve never met irl. we’re both 15 and have known each other since she was 11 and i was 12. dated for two months. 

she broke up with me a few weeks ago and i feel really bad about the way i reacted especially considering the fact that i also wanted to break up and it wasn’t even a bad breakup haha. and man i’m still in love with her and i know shes over it but i can’t get her out of my head.

my friend told me that i should block her on everything for a few months and only talk to her once im completely over everything. im not really sure if i’ll ever be completely over her but its been two days since i blocked her (well. i still have yet to block her number.) and for now im just hoping these feelings can go away soon. 

you never really meet people like her every day. for a while we thought that we were each others’ soulmates, and i already know—i’ll find someone else that’ll be better for me. i know i will, but right now, i don’t really want to. it’s hard to find people like her—shes always so passionate about everything she does and has this sort of energy that makes you want to be the best version of yourself that you can be. and even before we dated we had this sort of dynamic where we both just pushed each other to work harder for our own goals/dreams (or she mostly pushed me and i gently supported her but same thing lol). she understood me and was always there to comfort me whenever i had even the tiniest of problems and helped me feel comfortable with my body and with myself 
she’s easily one of the prettiest and smartest people ive ever met and she means the world to me :”)

at first when she asked to break up, she said that she loved me and she loved being with me but she couldnt be in a relationship with me anymore. and that was okay. it’s still okay. my first reaction was just to say it’s okay and then eventually i kept thinking about everything that happened and i had originally promised to stay friends with her and that i’d always be there for her even after we broke up but i just blew up. i blew up and said things that weren’t really true and exaggerated things she said to me just so i could find something to get angry about. i kept bothering her and telling her not to do or say specific things because they were hurting me without thinking that maybe saying those things would hurt her. well. it’s fucked up to say but part of me hoped that it would hurt her and part of me hoped that by doing any of that it would somehow bring her back to me and big surprise! it didn’t. that’s my fault.

maybe the hardest part of this has been knowing that i miss her more. i’ll go through all this trouble every day telling myself that even if i do this or that it’s not going to take back the things ive said or ive done and its not going to turn back time so that we’re still together. but ive probably barely even crossed her mind ever since we broke up—and good for her if that’s really the case, at least one of us can even move on. every time im watching a movie i just think “she would laugh at this” or “she would like this part” and i just realize how far i need to go until i can just be over her. i still wake up thinking about her and go to sleep thinking about her and at this point its just kind of stalkery and creepy i really need to stop hahahaa

sorry this is long, i got carried away at every part. i think i needed to get this out of my system, ive been bothering my friends about it for too long and i think part of me just hopes she’ll somehow see this and read everything. there’s really no chance of that but if you ever find this i hope youre doing okay and i hope we can be friends again when it finally settles in my head that this is over lol",actuallesbians,1577778426,yypica,,1,True,2019-12-31

6984,Needing help on stalker homophobic parents,"So I’ve been with my gf for a year now. For 6 months I lied about my whereabouts and said I was at a friends house who they didn’t know where they lived. They figured out she doesn’t live there and found out about my gf and me shortly after. 

For clarification they use a location tracker and demand my location is visible at all times, so I cannot just turn it off. 

I was thrown out of the house for a week, and had to stay with a friend. I’m not allowed to see my gf or I will be thrown out again. 

So for the last 6 months I’ve been using ispoofer which spoofs my location and puts me to wherever I want to be. I can say I’m at home but change my phones location to Russia if I wanted to. It works like a charm. Unfortunately it costs money, which I don’t have access to. 

However, as a I said my parents are stalkerish, they give me a monthly allowance for the work I do around the house which is loaded onto a card. They check this card’s charges very often and question everything I buy or do. 

My trial is running out this week and I’d appreciate if someone could help me out and purchase the licensing code for me. I’d do any favor in return that I could possibly do. I know this seems crazy and it’s out of my comfort zone to ask for money but I’m desperate and I just want to be with my girlfriend shamelessly and peacefully.

7007,In need of advice: thinking of breaking off friendship (of 2 years) with the girl I like (long story). Will put a tldr in.,"Hi,

TLDR: i like my good friend of 2 years. She likes me too. Due to all sorts of reasons it won't work. One big thing I'm struggling with is her closed off behaviour and I just cannot go on and am thinking of breaking off the friendship. Don't know how to go about it.

Bit of information: I'm not a native English speaker. We are both 18 years old.

So, I like this girl, she likes me. Sounds simple, but it's not.
She and I are friends for 2 years now, but 3 weeks ago she confessed she likes me and it's a mess. 
We've come to the conclusion multiple times that it wouldnt work, because:

1. We live a 5 hours train ride from eachother 
2. She's not out to her family
3. She's busy with uni and said she has no time for relationships.

After 2 weeks of looooooooong conversations, which  were always started by me because I'm a real ""let's talk this through"" person, I've told her we need to put this behind us and move on.

However when I told her that, she went all ""I'm hopefull for the future"". But when I ask how she sees things going, she responds with, ""idk how the future will go, but I don't want to put any option aside"". So she is not clear at all.

Reason for me saying that is the aforementioned reasons, but also because I was struggling a great deal with her not being open. I talked a lot about how I felt (awful, even anxious with the whole empty feeling, pressure on chest bit) and all that, but she never really told me how she felt. When I told her I needed space she went 'oh ok. Sure' and afterwards I found out she cried a lot and wanted to apologise in person. 
I also got the feeling she didn't care, because I have had no idea how she really felt and constantly have to guess or hear afterwards she felt awful.

Her reason for this behaviour: she finds me more important than her needs. So if I need space then we go all in regardless of how she feels.

I struggle a lot with this closeness and even so much that I'm scared to be open to her now, because I can't pinpoint her feelings.
So yesterday, I told her this struggle and I just said that I really value and want to know her opinion, her feelings because they're important.  Just be open.

She got mad, so I basically said that I can't do this and couldn't be in a relationship with such a closed off person, even if the first 3 reasons weren't a thing you know.

Later that evening, when I couldn't text because I was out with friends, she finally told me why she couldn't be open, that it's because of that she feels bad for confessing and then starting this messy snowball effect. So I said that with openness and communication things could've been solved, but now I don't dare to be open so it's just messed up.
She didn't want to text anymore last evening.

Tonight I asked her if she was ok, needee more space and all that .

I basically got hit with the ""I feel bad, I'll get over it. Let's just not talk about it"". 

Again she isn't open to me and I find that so so so difficult you know. 

So yeah, I don't think I can do this and perhaps want to break off the friendship. I feel so dreadful and anxious and sad now and I just can't.

So any advice is appreciated. Any way of going about this? Should I break off the friendship? Or anyway to mend it and all that?
I do miss the normal conversations and all, she is such a good friend of mine.

Many many thanks.",actuallesbians,1577060254,avatarkyoshi10,,1,True,2019-12-22

I feel like a less kinky/cool/real lesbian if that sort of thing doesn't super turn me on. I think it might be because I'm kind of demisexual until I fall in love with someone, which is unfortunate lol.

While I stood in front of the mugs, this girl (about my age, mid to late twenties) walked up and said “Wow. I hope this isn’t weird, but you are REALLY, REALLY pulling off that business casual look.” 

I just stared at her for what felt like a century and felt my face turn bright red. Then I mumbled some thanks and tried to act calm. 

She literally said “of course,” looked me up and down, smirked, and walked away. This WOULD happen to me while I’m in a committed relationship.

She broke things off, and I was sad.  We were never in an exclusive relationship. We didn't really talk for \~ 3 years and I eventually got over it. 

We met up for brunch today to catch up, and it was a bit awkward, because I know we were both nervous and we were both trying to establish boundaries. It wasn't the same as it was when we dated and this wasn't supposed to be a date. There was no chemistry like that or physical attraction, but I genuinely like her as a person and enjoyed meeting up with her despite the weirdness of it all. We still have things in common, and it's a bit crazy that we reconnected like this. When we said good bye, I felt weird because I felt like I was saying good bye to someone I know but I don't know if i'll ever talk to again. I'd like for us to be friends, or more like acquaintances instead of strangers. Is this weird? How could I go about it?

7038,Any other lesbians relate to the male sexual awakening?,"You always hear men talking about their first experiences discovering nudie magazines like Playboy and jacking off to the centerfolds, sneaking peaks of nude women in movies, watching porn, etc. I am a bisexual woman, and it recently dawned on me that I can totally identify with the male sexual awakening.

The first porn I ever discovered on the internet was lesbian, but even before that I would Google pictures of naked women. As a child I would draw both naked women and men that I saw in magazines. I used to stay up late to watch the ""Girls Gone Wild"" adverts, and I was obsessed with dancing scantily clad women in music videos (think..Nelly Furtado in 'Promiscuous Girl').

I never had crushes on boys in school, and when I finally did I now realise it was always a guy I would see making out with a cute girl in the hallway. I think I was misplacing my attraction.

I still choose to identify as bi, though (instead of lesbian) because throughout my teens I had real fangirl obsessions over male celebs. Granted they were always really androgynous guys..like Bill Kaulitz. But I have also had serious relationships with men where I was extremely sexually attracted to them. I will say that since I have grown more experienced dating men, I don't really feel romantically interested in then anymore. If I am interested in a man it is just sexual.

7042,Who else has ended a relationship to focus on personal growth?,"Hi all, I have been having a difficult time as of late that has affected my relationship with my girlfriend and was wondering if any other sapphic ladies can relate. 

In November, I was hospitalized for two weeks after a health crisis almost ended my life. I was essentially brain dead and comatose for the first week in the hospital, which I don't remember (obviously). When I woke up, I realized how many aspects of my life I need to change and how important it is I don't half-ass managing my health. I realized my situation is basically manage my health and change my life, or potentially die. 

So I've already decided I need to break up with girlfriend of 8 months (on again/off again) to focus on my health and building the life I want and becoming the person I want to. Right now, I feel like our relationship is keeping my from growing for a lot of reasons--her lack of managing her own health, what different life stages we are in, etc. And honestly, I'm really not in a place to be in a relationship right now. I almost died, and the thought of being committed to and responsible for anyone but myself is fucking terrifying. 

Has anyone else had to make this decision before? Did you find it difficult as well? What did you do? 

Thanks and hope everyone's having a happy holiday season xoxo",actuallesbians,1577081083,aboos_,,1,True,2019-12-23

7047,Is it typical to miss your very first girlfriend after being broken up for nearly two years?,"I feel like I’m beating my head against a brick wall and playing make believe while I fight the feelings. Like every day I pretend to be happy while most days I wish I could talk to her. We weren’t even together very long, just 8 months. But I think of her every day and I wonder if she misses me too. I came out at 29 and she was my first girlfriend and in a lot of ways I never knew love until I met her. I get to see her in my dreams sometimes and it makes my heart happy but then I realize I can’t talk to her. I used to describe her as my soul mate and I tell myself that one day when I’m ready, she will be there. Oh but that’s just a Dream and the realist in me knows I’ll never see her again. I was so hopeful that the pain and feeling of loss would subside and I would move on with my life with just some memories of her and our short life together, but the pain and feelings of missing that piece are still very much there and I can’t help but cry at random times like driving to work or when I’m in the shower. I feel awful for how I hurt her and how our relationship ended (even though she broke up with me) and I can’t seem to let go. I never had these feelings when I dated guys, but I suppose that’s because I never wanted to be with them anyway lol. It’s such a long story of how we ended and what happened during our relationship so I won’t get into that, but I’m curious if any other late comers have experienced this amount of loss that has lasted years post break up? I am currently in a relationship with a wonderful person but I can’t help but wish at times that she was my ex and then I feel even worse...maybe I am just a terrible human.

7050,Need advice,"Ok, so theres this girl i've been on a couple dates with. We hit it off super well our first date, and also had a great second date. However she's been coming on really strong (sexually). I'm very inexperienced, so i would much rather take it slow in that regard. 

On our first date, while we were walking to our cars she grabbed my boob out of the blue, which kinda made me uncomfortable. I got in her car and we chatted a little, then she played music. I asked if I could kiss her, which we did. Then she got really into it, and pretty much grabbed my boob and started kissing my neck. It makes me feel very conflicted, on one hand, I did like it. On the other, she was coming on really strong for my taste. After a bit, I stopped her, and she expressed how I looked panicked. A little after that we parted ways.

Second date, we got coffee, then went back to her place. We hung out, chatted, cuddled, watched netflix, and made dinner. Much more relaxed, so i was feeling ok. Then I had some wine, and by some, like half a bottle (im 135, so, that much wine is very effective). We chilled out a while longer, then she asked me if I wanted to fool around, I said yes but nothing too crazy. Well, ill hold some of the details but she stripped down completely, and got on top of me kissing me saying how she wanted to fuck me. I told her im not ready for that but she kept persisting. Nothing happened tho minus me semi reluctantly going down on her (she kinda told me to). Well after this, since I was pretty drunk, I spent the night there and left in the morning.

I just don't know how to feel about this situation, on one hand we have the exact same interests, and talking with her, it feels like im talking with a good friend. But at the same time, shes very sexually aggressive, and I kinda need more of a bond with someone to feel comfortable with that stuff.

My sexuality is really not a significant part of my identity at this point in life (I am a college instructor, officiate weddings and memorials, a senior project manager at an engineering firm, and a photographer-all of those identity markers are more important to me in a day to day basis).

But apparently a younger family member who lives in a small rural conservative as fuck town is “questioning their sexuality” and I found out through the family grapevine.  When I asked if I had permission to know this, I got the look of horror and shame.  Which means that this poor kid now has most of their extended family talking about them.  Likely along with hand wringing and gossiping about what to do.

To be fair, no one in my family is homophobic.  Everyone is likely concerned about the kid feeling loved and accepted.  Just that we are all a bunch of gossips 

I feel like banging my head on a wall, and telling everyone to shut up and stay out of the kids business until the kid is damn good and ready to have that conversation.  Seriously people, privacy!

We enjoyed it but I was in my own head a lot.","I had a gf before but she wasn’t ready for sex so we never did that. And I once got to second base with a girl but that was it. (I’m not a virgin though as I have also dated guys before). 

She’s my best friend’s cousin and we met for the first time the night it happened. I don't have a lot of experience in general so it was a little clumsy( we kept moving around a lot trying to find positions that work and fumbled a lot with the covers since it was cold and they kept falling off), and none of us came and at the end, we both admitted it was always hard for us to orgasm during sex. I personally didn't mind that I didn't come, but I felt like she was disappointed because she said she always made her ex-girlfriend climax pretty easily so she kept asking what went wrong and stuff. But I honestly don't think it was one thing but rather a combination of the following:    

\*I'm not used to casual sex. This was my first hookup ever  
\*I wasn't crazy attracted to her. I was attracted enough to want to sleep with her but not enough yo have the best sex ever I guess   
\*I'm still not completely over my ex-gf and wished it was her I had my first lesbian sex with   
\*I always had difficulty orgasming with my ex-boyfriend so I went into it with the assumption that it was gonna be the same and kept stressing out about coming and even tried to force it out at some point
\*I kept worrying that she was giving more than I was giving back and every time she did something to me I’d stop her halfway and start doing the same on her. Towards the end she told me she’s a giver and that I should just let her she’s a giver and that’s when I started to relax a little
\*I just kept getting distracted and thinking about everything and anything instead of just being in the moment. 
\*We stayed up very late until like 5 or 6am do I was super tired. 

At the end she said “Well now we know sex doesn’t work out for us.” Which I didn’t get. I don’t think you have to come sex to work but that would’ve been better of course. She insisted she enjoyed it though, and I thought it was fun too. I liked eating pussy more than I thought I would so yay me!

I’ve (28) been dating my current GF (26) for about a year now and she has the most extreme moods swings of any woman I have ever dated right before her period starts. I don’t experience mood swings like that myself. There was a time when I did, so I understand what she’s experiencing, but it’s never been in the last year while we’ve been dating, so she doesn’t understand what it’s like being on my end. 

I’m at a complete loss of what to do. I love her, I do, and I understand that every partner should have a certain level of tolerance for the other, but I feel like this is out of control. Her mood swings cause her to be extremely insecure, argumentative, overly emotional when I try to talk to her about things calmly, impatient, insensitive... among other things. I understand that most women experience these things to varying degrees, but it causes us to get into extreme fights. Every. Single. Month. Right before her period. Our last fight was about a week ago and we’re still struggling to recover from it. They usually take a while to resolve. 

I’m so sick of these fights. So much so, I’d almost rather end things between us. I’ve tried asking her to talk to a doctor about her hormones to see if birth control would help her regulate her hormones, but she won’t do it. I don’t know why, but she won’t. I feel bad for talking to her about this because I know it’s a sensitive issue and I don’t want her to feel like I’m blaming her for everything because I’m not, but I don’t know what else to do. Her hormones are at an intolerable level. I have tried being so sensitive in how I handle this with her and she just gets overly emotional about it no matter what time of month it is or how good of a mood she’s in. I’ve tried to be so careful about my wording and nothing seems to help.

Little things like- “*ex gf* uses that same face wash” or “I bought *ex gf* a birthday gift there once...she really likes *insert some hobby*” or “*ex gf* is really *insert some positive quality*.” I like that my girlfriend says only positive things about her exes, but it, coupled with the fact they spend so much time talking, makes me feel really uncomfortable, jealous, and bit sick to my stomach.

7121,Yelling at the wind: Feeling alone. How do you meet people?,"(This is more of a verbal diarrhea cause I need to get this off my back - TLDR at the end but I just need to yell at the wind)

Guys, I dunno what to do.

I am having a really tough time - here is some context.  

I have had... Had... The same tribe of friends for about 15 years. We were tight... So tight.  We did everything together.  Most nights some or all of us were hanging out.  Over the last few years I have been doing a lot of work on myself... Losing weight (over 150lbs so far), eating well, working with a psychologist on historical damage, coming out.  I have changed a lot - for the better.  

Part of my healing has been learning to ask for help, to ask for what I need.  

I have been working hard on myself, but a few months ago... I had a pretty big downswing.  I asked my friends for some help... I said hey guys I need one on one time groups are really hard right now.

This is where things took for a turn.

Short version - I got tossed like the trash. Looking back I guess there were signs, and you cant change groups, but my chosen family just shoved me away.  Stonewalled and gas lighted me (said from a mutual friend who watched it all going WTF!)  

I had to walk away.

Things were said, things were done... That I will never forgive them for.

I deserve better.

This has left me with no tribe... lost my chosen family... people I love.  And no local friends... Well a couple but not like that you know.

But that's not the full issue but this is needed for context.

Part of what my psychologist wanted me to work on was making more friends - getting out beyond my tribe (ironic eh?) and meeting queer people.  I have no local queer friends at all.

Now, hurting and truly alone it is even more important that I meet new people... And Id love to meet some other WLW... Hell, dating would be cool though not till I'm on the other side of this for sure... Cause I don't want to be that weird no friend girl. 

Problem is I have no idea where to meet WLW in my area (Victoria BC Canada).  I have tried meetups, but the all age lesbian group one has nothing that pertains to my interests... and the lesbian group that has a bunch of meetups that look super interesting to me has an at limit of 40 (I'm 45).  That really crushed me.  They do board games, and hikes and other things that align with my interests... But I'm to old.

How do I meet people?!

I am hurting and missing my people... But I will not go back (whats the saying you don't drink poison just because your thirsty)... And I don't want to seem desperate but I need local friends... And I am an introvert and have no idea how to start.  I went to a geocaching meetup but as much as I love geocaching, the people didn't gel with me.  I have gone to some pubs by myself but that was fruitless.  There are no lesbian bars here.  I am a member of the pride society in town but that's just more of monetary support. 

I love video games, hiking, swimming, geocaching, board games, D&amp;D, cooking, Whiskey &amp; Tequila tasting, tech, photography and all sorts of geeky things.

But how do I meet WLW?  How do I not be that friendless weirdo? 

It's so frustrating being to old for the fun stuff :-/... 

Missing my friends comes and goes like a wave... Today's a bad day... Christmas, Star wars... These are things we did together.  I hear how they are doing... How I've been replaced... And knowing I never mattered hurts... and it amps the loneliness... I am doing so much better than I was moths ago... But when its like this it makes me realize how alone I am... And how its not ideal.

So how the hell do you meet people - again not really asking for answers cause its so location specific but needed to yell at the wind... Hi Wind.

7126,I am SO FUCKING LONELY AND SEXUALLY FRUSTRATED,"Any time I see anything like a cute picture of two girls kissing or holding hands I feel sick to my stomach. Whenever I hear any mention of sex from anyone anywhere it makes me feel sick to my stomach. I become filled with feelings of dread and loneliness and bitterness. I want those things so so so badly. I want to be touched. I want to be loved. I’ve waited my whole life for this and I still never get it. I’ve been in a relationship with exactly one person. She’s the only one I’ve ever so much as held hands with. She was abusive and made everything miserable though. I’m just so sick of it all. I don’t know how much longer I can take this until I actually end up killing myself. I feel so empty all the time. There’s no one to talk to when I’m sad, no one to hug, no one to hold hands with, no one to have any type of intimacy with in my life. I thought I was close to my breaking a good year ago, but after a recent thing where one of my straight friends flirted with me constantly and gave me a feeling of hope for the first time in a very long time, I feel worse now whan I ever have. That was all months ago now, and now that I’ve settled back into the realization that nobody likes me like that, I feel worse than I ever have. Like holy shit. Idk what to do anymore. I can’t even live my day to day life without being reminded of how fucking SAD AND LONELY I always am. ANY reminder that sex and romance is a thing that actually happens in life makes me feel fucking AWFUL. I started to cry typing that sentence. I can’t masturbate without feeling horribly lonely after. I can’t watch porn without crying. Idk what to do. I’m so broken that I don’t think anyone will ever give me the time of day at this point. I’m so pathetic. Idk how to even have sex, I’ve only been with one person and like I said she was abusive so she always ended up berating me for something, so I avoided having sex with her in every way possible :/ I’m clueless, and I have extraordinarily bad anxiety so I can forget about hooking up with anyone too.

7131,Somehow I ended up in a thruple?,"So I’m(25 F) in a bit of a situation with this girl(28 F) in my program. Initially, I wasn’t really interested in her, which is a bit strange because I had a dream where we were couple at the start of my program. I noticed that she randomly started hugging me and paying extra attention to me at school, which was weird considering we never really talked much outside of a few conversations. 

Fast forward to September where we go out for a friend’s birthday. I walk in and say hello to everyone as usual, when C walks up to me and throws her arms around me and says “I turn gay when I get drunk and you might be the one tonight.” I just brushed it off not thinking much of it. But the arm touching, the hugs, the laughing at all my jokes started to make sense.

A few months go by and we continue our flirting back and forth. I notice that she also starts flirting with another guy in our class, D. So much to the point where everyone started joking about how we are a threesome. She ends up randomly telling me how she had been with a girl before and wanted it to happen again. I, knowing how straight women can be, decided not to read too much into it. I didn’t feel comfortable being someone’s experiment. In October, we went out to a club and flirted a little bit as we usually do. But at one point she goes over to D, and they start dancing on each other. I was admittedly a little jealous, so I dipped off and decided to talk to some guy at he bar. That night after the club we end up cuddling in the back seat of an uber and she stayed the night in my living room. Nothing happened, but the next day at school she went around telling everyone that she stayed over and I made her breakfast.
School got really busy around this time so we didn’t have time to really hang out. But if I ever mentioned I was heading to the mall or to grab food, she always made it a point to offer to ride with me to keep me company. Around this time she also started telling people I was her girl, and joke about how neither I or D wouldn’t give her any. 

Before I left for thanksgiving, a few of us stayed behind in class to talk. C and D are sitting next to each other and I decide to leave, as I could tell D was only sticking around so he could talk to C alone. I later found out that he invited her over for dinner and a movie. So I, being the person I am, decided to tell her I was seeing a movie that we had been talking about and mentioned she could join if she wanted. Long story short, our movie was uneventful. No cuddling, kisses. She just grabbed me for a hug before leaving. Her movie night with D, however, ended with them having sex and she stayed night. I found out because she told me EVERYTHING. 

I was so confused as to why she would tell me this, and I decided to keep my distance from her for a little while until the other day. We got drunk at happy hour and she went on and on about how I was her girlfriend and was coming over to hang out with me after we left. She was even kissing me on my neck and cheeks in front of everyone. She came over and talked about her time with D AGAIN, while I sat and listened. She claimed she regretted doing it but didn’t know if it would happen again. I sat down next to her and somehow we drunkenly made out for like two hours and she left saying she had to go but that was “much better than D”.

I have no idea what the hell is the deal with this situation.

7135,I feel like no one really gets it,"I’m(19) taking a semester off from school and coming home and I also started going out with a girl about a month ago. We were both into each other for over a year but just started going out. It’s not like we were dating for that long and we’re literally 100s of miles apart now so there was no point continuing anything. I’m still pretty sad about it though. She’s the first person I’ve dated and I really liked her. 

I’ve been trying to talk to friends about it but on separate occasions different people have called it “cute” when I tell them I was dating a girl and literally just stop talking when I say I’m feeling bad about it. It’s not how they act when other girls in the group talk about problems they have w their boyfriends. I can’t help feeling like they get to “oh it’s cute you’re dating a girl” and then their thought process just stops after that. 

I guess it just kinda sucks that people I thought I’d be able to talk to somehow just don’t get what I’m feeling. I don’t really know how to find people that do now. I know it could be way worse but I’m still upset.

I won't go into detail because I'm genuinely worried she might be a user of reddit and this sub lol (happy to use DMs).

I'm still exploring my sexuality, I've only ever been in one relationship and it was with a guy (mainly because I wait for things to happen and only make a move when I know it'll be serious).

I'm not massively religious but I've never been with a woman before, so my sincere apologies if anything I've said is insensitive or outright daft.

7153,Am I being ridiculous here?,"I recently met a girl on tinder. She was very forward, asked me out for a drink within a few messages and as someone that hates small talk I loved this. Since she first messaged me she’s been very slow at responding. I met up with her regardless two nights ago and it went really really well. She’s 25, insanely beautiful and kind. She said she’s bi but more into women, she’s never been in a relationship with a woman before she wants to, it just hasn’t happened and has had sex with a girl two times. I’m also the first girl she’s met from tinder.

Fast forward to later that night, things definitely got hot and heavy in my car. Lots of intense making out, hands everywhere, etc. I could tell she was on cloud 9 and I was right there with her.
So what’s the problem? She’s awful at responding to me, yesterday she only texted me twice when I wanted nothing more than to talk to her after our amazing night. Today I called her, she declined my call and hasn’t returned it yet. I’m not sure if I’m just being anxious that I could just be an experiment for her. Being someones first lesbian relationship in my late 20s along with this lack of communication makes me feel uneasy.

Part of me feels like I deserve someone who meets me half way and wants to talk to me as much as I do, but part of me wonders if this might be a lot for her or she’s just bad at texting?

7157,Sexual harrassment by a woman at a bar,"I'm  a 26 year old, transgender lesbian. I've only been out for a few  months, and a couple weeks after coming out, I had this very weird and  uncomfortable thing happen to me at a bar. I posted about it on a trans  forum at the time, but I thought that after finding this place, I'd get  some lesbian-centered input on it, as well.

  
I  was hanging out at a “barcade” (bar with retro arcade game cabinets)  with a very good cis female friend. She’s been extremely warm and  helpful to me since I came out, giving me advice and encouragement,  going shopping with me, and accompanying me in public while in  girl-mode. I’ve been afraid of going out as a woman alone, so it’s been a  huge help that she’s been around to be my social wingman so I don’t  feel so out of place, and so I’m not alone in case anything bad goes  down. I’m 6’3” tall, not super feminine in build (though not super  masculine either, I don’t think, just sort of “box-shaped”), hormones  had not completed all their work yet, my voice is a work in progress and  wasn't great at the time, and I wasn't getting fancy with makeup at  that stage, so I definitely didn’t pass. However, that particular night,  I was wearing a skirt, leggings, slightly padded bra, feminine jacket,  long (real) hair, a purse, and makeup that covered my beard shadow  pretty well, so most people looking at me would probably get the hint  that I’m trying to be read as a woman. Here’s a play-by-play of what  happened, remember that it took place really fast and I was constantly  confused about what was going on.

  
My  friend had been by my side most of the night, but she left to go  register for karaoke and to get another drink, so I was alone on the  other side of the bar for a few minutes. While glancing around me, I  noticed that about ten feet away there was a cute girl I’d never seen  before who was getting cuddly with a guy at the bar, who I presumed was  her boyfriend. Some thirty seconds later, that same girl noticed me and  said my outfit looked nice. I thanked her, genuinely happy that someone  complimented my appearance and felt good about myself. Then, some ten  seconds later, she left the bar and came up to me by herself, and  started talking to me, asking my name, saying I looked nice, stuff like  that.  
   
While  doing this, she got really close to me, and started bumping into me. In  another few seconds she moved forward, got on her tiptoes to move her  head further up (she was a lot shorter than me), and started putting her  arms around me. Extremely confused, I thought she was trying to kiss  me, so I backed away a bit and said “What are you doing?” She said “I’m  trying to hug you,” and proceeded to give me a quick hug, despite me  already having backed away a couple inches and stopping her from  continuing to hug me previously. Then she asked about the arcade game we  were standing next to, and asks to play it with me.  
   
Very  uncomfortable at this point and not knowing what to do, I said yes.  While we took turns playing, she kept complimenting my ability,  exaggeratedly going “Wow!” and stuff like that every time I did  something simple in the game, while quickly dying every time it was her  turn; she clearly did not seem to actually be invested in the game and  wanted to be there for me for some reason. She also kept edging closer  and bumping me with her hips, while I backed away a bit each time she  does. (The guy she was with at the bar was still where he was sitting  before, so I presume he could see what’s happening.)  
   
After  what feels like an eternity but must have been less than three or four  minutes, my friend finally came back, introduced herself to the girl,  and then after some brief introductory conversation between the two of  them, some other friend of the girl came to her and said they have a  table on the other side of the bar, so they both said goodbye and walked  away with the guy that the girl was cuddling with initially. I talk to  my friend briefly about what was going on, and neither of us could  figure what the girl was doing. We could only come up with three  options:  
1.  She clocked me as a trans woman and decided to try being supportive in  an extremely stupid way. I’m not sure why someone would think that  immediately trying to embrace a stranger and repeatedly touching them  while they back away is supportive, but who knows.

  
2.  She (and possibly the guy she was with) clocked me as a trans woman and  decided to try to mess with me and make me uncomfortable.

  
3.  She thought I was attractive and was trying to (very badly) flirt with  me, even though she was in full view of someone who appeared to be her  boyfriend who presumably saw the whole thing. Weird, but maybe they have  an open relationship. Maybe it's a unicorn hunter thing.  


  
Any  thoughts? I mean, it was inappropriate any way you slice it; if a man  did this to a cis woman, it would be called sexual harassment. She was  either beyond clueless to not see that I did not want her attention, or  she was intentionally being mean. 📷",actuallesbians,1577152238,Lucca01,,1,True,2019-12-23
7158,Help Navigating Non-Monogomy/ Possible Disinterest,"Met this girl a few weeks ago. 1st date, dinner +walking around talking, hug goodnight. 2nd date: canolli n coffee followed by cuddling/kissing at her place (her suggestion). 3rd date: climbing. We were supposed to meet up for a 4th, but some stuff happened and she cancelled. I had texted her ""hey, stuff can be hard. let me know what you need. talk, space, memes, whatever""  and she never responded. But then a few days later she texted me, and we climbed for date 4. 5th date: bar + ""the talk"" where she told me she was non-monog and not looking for anything super serious ""only due to being just out a long relationship"". But she said we had an intellectual connection and she likes me and wants to take things slow, and that she likes that I don't text much. I made it clear I was ok as long as non-monog not synonymous w/ not caring. That night we kissed, and she stayed the night, but we just cuddled, kissed and held each other. She even held me a bit when I went to a bad headspace when things were heating up a lil. She said this was the slow pace she dug. 

The next morning we kissed n cuddled and I drove her home. Asked if I 'd see her before she left for xmas, she said she'd text. Wasnt expecting to hear from her tbh. But yesterday she texted me a song she has a tattoo of. I was busy so waited a few hours, not even sure how to respond. Then eventually texted back a few msgs commenting on song/her tat and sent her 2 other songs. No response today. Assuming I won't see or hear from her before she leaves on xmas. Almost texted her to climb tonight but seemed desperate. Plus I work in oncology and work was fcking hard today. Even after we spent the night together, I wanted some space too, but I don't want to put her off either.

I just can't tell what's up with this girl. And honestly, I'm attracted to her, but something feels a lil off. I just don't feel like she cares for me much. The past few times we've hung out, I just feel strangely empty after, like I never really know what's coming next. I know some of it is my own insecurity, and she's stressing open communication and said if she ever hurts my feelings, to tell her. But I kinda feel like she's fixing to ghost any sec. I just don't get the sense she cares very much about me, and I guess it's bumming me out, n I'm having trouble sussing out whether it's true or not. 

Current plan is to not text, then maybe text next week when she's back asking to climb/hang. But I dunno, my insecurity is kinda on high alert, and I just don't feel like she cares very much, and it's bumming me out. In the past, I would've taken my dignity and broken it off. But queer dating is hard, and sad to say, sometimes something sucky feels a bit better than being completely alone...

Many of the people giving commentary were quick to bash the guy for not wanting a threesome with his girlfriend. Only one girl was defending the guy and everyone else was saying things like “You can kiss a girl and not be gay, but I can’t kiss a guy and be not gay”, and a couple of women were talking about how their husbands likely wouldn’t care if they hooked up with their female friends. I was like, what am I watching?

We had a Christmas party a few weeks ago, I got very drunk and have no idea what I might have said to her. I just know I was very touchy.. I remember her intensely  staring at me at one point in the night however and when I apologised the next say she said I was being very cute..

Don't know how to read it though as she is quite a bit older and divorced.. I just want to know if I should subtly pursue this (how??) or if I should just let it go. Any advice appreciated!",actuallesbians,1577172616,Kat994,,1,True,2019-12-24

I told I rather keep that even if it meant to stop talking because she is very social. She decided to still keep seeing eachother and talking. We've gotten to a point where we're relatively close and it happened fast considering it's only been a few months. I tried denying it but she grew on me, I don't really seek to try asking her out, I just want to tell her how I feel to get it off my chest.

7185,My friend is coming out and needs encouragement!,"Soo my friend (identifies as bi) has a gf for a year now. After passing the board exam, she came out to her mother and also mentioned that she has a girlfriend...

As all traditional filipino families are, her mother was reluctant and doesn't really like where she's headed. Statements such as ""dont u dare make your boobs smaller"", ""what if u fall for a guy"", and ""what if u'd want kids in the future"" were her arguments.

Since her gf's family is a lot more open and accepting, she's having doubts if her gf deserves to be treated this way by her family.

She also said, ""i just now realized that there really is a chance that they'll never accept me.""

7186,Tips for starting to date women?,"Hello! I'm a bi 21F. I'm very inexperienced when in comes to relationships. The longest one I have had was with a guy and it lasted about 6 weeks, and it wasn't even official. I have anxiety surrounding relationships, because I typically only date someone if I see potential for a long term relationship.  When you add compulsory heteronormativity on top of that it makes women seemingly impossible to approach romantically. I didn't realize I was bi for a long time, even though I was pretty flirty with other women, because I was so stuck in galpal mode I felt that it was okay because we were ""really good friends so of COURSE it isn't flirting"".

I'm considering joining HER because tinder in my town isn't the best, but if I do match with a gal and we do meet up I'm afraid that I'll do what I usually do due to residual internalized homophobia and act overly-platonic, rather than showing a romantic interest.  

So I guess this really boils down to these questions:
1. How do you overcome mental blocks such as doubt, anxiety, and internalized homophobia in order to approach other women romantically?
2. Just some basic dating tips pertaining to women??? Especially first dates. Just want to make sure I treat said date right and come across as appropriately flirty 😭",actuallesbians,1577178053,Dieanderen,,1,True,2019-12-24

My Sims builds are pretty easy, so beginners can learn and follow along if they'd like 😊
I build from scratch and also have a ""fixer upper"" series where I modernize and change houses that were in the game that I personally don't like.

To preface, these men were messaging me after I made an NSFW post on my other account so I expected their messages to be sexual in nature.

I was talking to one guy about this sweet girl I met on tinder and he asked me if I had any sex toys. Kind of out of the blue lol. I told him I don’t, and he asked me how we (the girl and I) are going to have sex. He insisted that we could not have good sex without a phallic toy which irked me beyond belief. I tried to explain to him that there are many ways for women to have sex without anything like that and he said “well, that’s just my opinion”. your opinion? you, a cis man, have an opinion on sex between two women, which has absolutely nothing to do with you?

Another man said it was a shame I’m not interested in men because it’s “one less girl who doesn’t enjoy a good fucking” or something like that. Which just completely rubbed me the wrong way.

7231,Queer relationship ending.. I do not want to continue to build resentment toward her or men in general...,"So... I'm gonna to my best to sum up what I'm going through. It'd be awesome if you'd hang in there and provide any advice if you have experience with this.. or just can see this objectively and give me some advice that would be wonderful. A few days ago I had a relationship of over one year with my ex girlfriend come to an end, very abruptly. It, apparently, spewed out of her on video chat while I'm home with my family for Christmas although she says she intended to speak in person when I got back from vacation.

Her reasoning? Many things, she needs to work on her mental health more and doesn't want to continue to mistreat me, we just aren't functioning well as partners anymore, etc. 

Now, let's give some background. Early on in our relationship she confessed to me some sexual traumas from her childhood and from the beginning I provided a safe space for her to open up about this and encouraged her to seek therapy. Therapy, programs, crisises, medication, etc. later, and lots of hard work, all of which I have been there for her for through and through. During this process, she said that she was sure she loved women but was not sure how much her trauma affected her ability to view men sexually/pursue relationships with them.   


For a few reasons, deep seeded and also sexually traumatic reasons for me, I have always really not liked cisgendered straight men. I know that a lot of it is because of society and how they adapt in it, but I just find them to be terrible honestly. I think also I've always had issues with thinking I would never be enough for girls cause I don't have a penis, I can't impregnate them, I can't provide them an easy path through homophobic parts of society, etc. I do not like that I have so much hate and resentment built up against men, it's not good for me and YES, I KNOW, ""not all men"", etc. etc. etc. She's always known that I am very insecure about this and I'm not proud about this quality of mine.

So she opens up about the reasons why she wants to break up, that she thinks we would both ""grow more"" if we were ""alone"", etc. When I asked whether this also had to do with whether she wanted to date other people (she's mentioned interest in polyamorous lifestyles before) she said ""hmmm..yeah.. a little.. men are just so new to me"" and goes on to talk about how she did have sex dreams about guys during our relationship and that even after she pseudo broke up with me over video chat, that she flirtaciously smiled at some guy as did he. Why is she telling me this? God fucking knows, a decent person would know that this is oversharing and a generally hurtful thing to say to someone you're breaking up with much less someone she knows struggles with these insecurity issues.

Let me preface this, I was not always the best partner, we argued, I have mental health issues, etc.  Anyway, for whatever her reasons are for this breakup and however big wanting to explore her identity in general much less her sexual identity, I cannot help but just feel so used. I was there through everything, from the beginning I helped her feel comfortable with sex in general, held her when she felt vulnerable, cried, encouraged the progress she was making in healing from her childhood trauma, etc. Ever since she admitted that her trauma could have affected her sexual identity and that she could be bi or pan or anything, I had this intense fear that she'd grow tired of me and want to move onto men. 

I do not want to harbor so much resentment toward her because I am trying to be accepting that she does deserve to try new experiences, understand who she really is, etc. I do not want to harbor resentment toward men in general because that is not healthy. But damn, I feel so used. I feel like I helped her work through this just for her to abandon me at a time when I am just starting to get my mental health back on track, when her companionship and love would really help me. I feel like I was just some stepping stone she used so she could work through her trauma, open up when it comes to sex, just for her to leave me, move to a new city, leave me behind in the city we fell in love in, and go live a new life somewhere else. 

There are so many more intricacies to this, and don't even get me started on the fact she ended our extremely significant relationship (she talked with me about having a future, having kids, moving in, etc. even when I said we should take it day by day to protect myself) on VIDEO CALL 20 minutes before she had to leave for work. Didn't even contact me again until 10pm that night to check in on me (even though she knows I have been prone to self harm, substance abuse, etc. during times of depression) and offer more explanations on this (and before this she restricted me on facebook, deleted all of our pics and videos, etc) My friends who struggle with personality disorders (like my ex is) say this is classic BPD behavior.  I didn't eat for three days after she broke things off, I really really REALLY fucking loved her. Anyway, I don't really need advice on how she ended this relationship, just this feeling of being used and not wanting to resent bi girls over this, cause let's be honest, behavior like this is a big reason why lesbians do not like to date women who are interested in men, although it's stereotypical and bi-phobic behavior. I don't want to resent all men and continue to feel completely ""less than"" when it comes to them, their behavior, and how their shitty behavior seems to always be accepted and excused by straight women, how they can give girls things I can't etc.

I know this is a long and winding post, but the rug was totally pulled out from under me and I'm just doing my best to heal and not build resentment toward someone I was in love with. I've seen some posts on here from cis straight men, so I kindly ask for advice from queer people only, since this is meant to be a queer thread after all.

Happy holidays everyone, if any of you have made it this far, and can offer me some advice on how to handle this going forward, that'd be an amazing gift. I'm in this place where I am debating whether speaking to her in person when I am back is even a good idea.

7232,met my gf after 4 months apart!,"yes, the title said it all. we started long distance, then had our summer break together, and now after 4 months of school it's 2 weeks winter break! 

i stayed at her house for the whole morning, we talked for 20-30 minutes or so, then it was all making out until lunch. i was full of anxiety because of school and personal stuffs, but being hugged by her made my anxiety calm down significantly. after lunch we made out again for an hour (i didn't know kissing could be that long??) then i left for my art club. i sneaked back to her house for 30 more minutes before going home, was almost late for dinner, but soooo worth it.

i also wanted to tell her ""hey you can touch my boobs too don't linger on my back only"" but i was too busy kissing her and didn't want to leave, so i guess maybe next time. we are definitely going super slow compared to normal couples, but we are learning how to get comfortable with each other, and it's both our first time when it comes to things further than handholding (both of us are each other's first kiss!), so i am glad she is going with the pace i want.

7234,"Do you think this girl just expects me to take the initiative, or is she simply not interested?","So I've been talking to this girl for a little while. We go to different colleges so our main form of communication is texting. She is bi, and knows I'm gay well. Anyway, we were introduced by a mutual friend, and we get along well. She is really great and I'd like to get to know her better, at least become friends with her. Of course the ideal situation would be dating her eventually tho.

Problem is I can't tell how interested she is, even in becoming friends. When texting, I'm always the one that starts the conversation. I also carry it tbh, since her responses are usually short and and she barely asks questions. I don't want to force it so I usually let the convo die rather quickly. That being said, she does always reply, and doesn't take long to do so either. Usually 5-10 minutes. I still feel like she might just be doing so to not seem rude.

I have asked her out, and she has agreed to go out like 2/4 times. The times she rejected, she did have reasons not be able to go. When we have gone out it has gone well, there are no awkward silences, and time flies by. The vibe is friendly rather than flirty, but I'm ok with that since we are still getting to know each other and like I said, I'm cool with being friends in the end. So hey, maybe she just doesn't like texting, right? That'd be cool I mostly use texting to set up irl dates anyway... but I'm kinda hesitant to ask her out again since, much like with texting, I'm also always the one that asks her out.

I'd be nice to have her initiate something once, but I honestly don't mind that much. I have several friendships like this, where I always initiate conversations and make plans, and I still feel like we are good friends. It's more that I don't want to seem pushy. The last time I asked her out she did accept and we had a good time, but since I stopped asking, it's almost been a month without seeing each other. She is really attractive, and since she is bi idk if she is used to guys pursuing her and taking the initiative?

So, what do you think? Is this normal and I'm overreacting, and should ask her out again or should I take the hint and leave her alone? If you couldn't tell, I've never dated anyone, not even casually... so this is all completely new to me and I have no clue what I'm doing. So, what do I do?.",actuallesbians,1577210529,plshelpthank,,1,True,2019-12-24

I'm bi-curious, and I'm almost certain she's a lesbian. I think she will eventually end up telling me because we're getting closer to one another day by day and our conversations are starting to shift. In the case that she does come out, I want to make sure I don't say anything insensitive, or stupid. So what things should I definitely avoid, or what things would you like to hear if you were in her place?

Just looking for generic advice, such as avoiding ""did you have a crush on me?"" and that usual stuff you don't like to hear - anything that might seem insensitive/inappropriate

Background Info: 
- We're just friends at the moment (of course doesn't feel like so and I've never had this feeling with someone of the same gender before - feels a lot like the onset of a past serious relationship)

- She's very confident, carrys so much self-assurance and tenacity with her (something I love)

- I've had numerous moments that made me feel she does have feelings towards me, and her confidence only strengthens this observation

- I would consider opening up to her too - just need a bit of courage my end

Sometimes I feel alone in this respect. Now some members of my family are decent people that are loving, supportive and positive forces to be around but my mom...we’re like oil and water in how different we are. Namely my mom is so critical and judgmental about everything. Literally there’s nothing one could do that my mother doesn’t have anything asinine to say about. Which is exhausting as I’ve always been pretty laid back when it comes to socializing and understanding of others. To my mom everything she does is great, and no one can outdo her. It’s pretty alienating that even my brother just locks himself up in his room and tunes everyone’s out, just coming out to eat and drink sometimes or to catch up with me. I constantly get put in the position of confessional, where she outdoors all her vitriol onto me and then some and if I try to escape I get destroyed. Looking back, this makes me afraid of what a future girlfriend might think as in all honestly, I rather interact with my family as least as possible, especially in what should be festive and happy times. Even my other step siblings have backed off them, and have tried to do other things with their SO families or done a thing with just us the siblings and friends. But while my brothers get away with it I get chastised harshly. I often feel guilty for feeling like this.

( it can translate to multiple meanings in my language) I was like ''Layan'' I think I might've said why can't really remember, then she went on (first and only time we talked so far), then a few days later/a week maybe, I was standing against the wall when I zoned out, I looked down and I see her and her squad with multiple of them/maybe all (sorry my memory sucks) of her squad staring at me, when I looked at her she was on her knees Smirking and whispering to one of her friends we stared into each others' eyes for a second (she knew that I saw her and she continued staring) then her eyes went down on her friend's cheek and continued whispering, then a few seconds after her friends started to laugh then I left, and like 2 times after I caught her staring at me, once when she and her squad were placing their arms on eachother telling something, she was silent, I was staring at the floor while eating, and I raised my head and saw her staring at me while her friends were saying something, the second time when I was hearing my friend's stories then I turned my head and saw her staring at me, then I broke the eye contact (Last Thursday), and once I was walking by I heard her say ''I swear i'll get her number!"" (She might've not meant me just to give you a possibility for her homosexuality, it can also be a joke).  just FYI I am 14 (Straight) she is 13 (Not really sure if she's straight) and it's not normal religiously and culturally for us to be LGBTQ (all girls school) she has a 15 year old sister who has a crush on one of my friends.

It's been almost a week and I have not (caught) her staring at me, she might've done but I am not sure, and I am going to tell one of my BFFS tomorrow, I kept this a secret for almost a week and the reason why I have not told anyone is that I feel bad that she will get in trouble because I said something to my friends that makes her seem like a lesbian (since my religion is against it even tho I find nothing wrong with it)

&amp;#x200B;

When she actually called me ''pretty/beautiful girl'' I did not think much of it, but after I caught her staring multiple times this came into my head. I'll be flattered if she actually liked me but I am straight it'll be hard to reject her if she confessed.

We live in Canada. My parents used to talk about how the bible says gays need to die, but once I came out they actually were somewhat okay with it, which I'm extremely lucky for. They ended up being very accepting and are now accepting of the entire lgbt+ community, which I'm incredibly lucky for.

This girl lives about a 4 hour drive from me. She was on vacation with my best friend, when her brothers went through her room (they are a devout Muslim family). They found condoms, dildos, and weed. After an argument on the phone they figured out she was gay. They immediately drove to pick her up, and her brothers beat her. She wont call the police. She has locked herself in her room, but I'm not certain shes going to be safe as her brothers said they were going to kill her. She said to my friend she will be safe, but this sounds like the beginning to a terrible story. I told my friend she could come stay with me if she could get here, if she could afford the  $60 ish train ticket. But she stopped responding to my friend, and my friend stopped responding to me.

I dont even know this girl, but I'm actually shaking right now. I cant imagine how she must be feeling. I want to help her.

7280,"UPDATE: Am I in denial? I'm Muslim, she's Jewish","Hi all,

Update since my previous post ...

We had dinner today (the usual weekly). I told her just how I felt and that I'd never felt this way towards another woman (I think I appeared nervous too - I couldn't help it). I noticed she stayed calm, didn't interrupt, and allowed me to finish. I told her I might regret opening up for a few reasons; my grandmother recently passed away and she had so much respect for her, I didn't have any experience with women, and finally I wasn't even 100% sure she was interested. My biggest fear was coming off as someone who just wanted to explore, and I made this clear to her - I told her I'd completely understand if she wasn't convinced that I'm serious, and that I wouldn't be offended if she rejected me on this basis.

Once I finished, she thanked me for being honest and sincere, told me that I read her correctly and that, yes, she too felt the same way. She went on for a good 15 minutes about why she loves me. She was very passionate, self-assured and collected, something I absolutely adore in her. She then told me that she didn't want me to feel guilty for being inexperienced, and that she would be happy to take things slowly, patiently. That she understood the challenges I could face with extended family members if I decide to come out, and that she would always be there to support me. 

She thanked me once more and gave me the warmest kiss. I'm looking forward to seeing her again.

Sorry was only able to add more detail in my earlier post, she knows now though

It took a lot of mental work and talking to my friends and family to help me get there but I’m good. Someone in this channel commented on one of my posts about ways to get through a break up and it really helped. I had to think of the reasons why we weren’t going to work and it just clicked. I felt that I had to change a lot of things about me to love you the way you wanted to be loved and communicate in ways that I didn’t know how, and I couldn’t change anymore. I have changed so much about myself that some of my friends could barely recognize me and how I behaved. They knew I loved you and that I was incredibly loyal to you but the changes were astonishing. I looked in the mirror months ago and could not recognize myself without you, now I look in the mirror and I know how I am again. 

Like we have both said we don’t regret what we had, but we regret how it had needed to end. A small part of me will always love you but I know and you know that we won’t ever be again. Thank you for being in my life. If you need me, you know how to contact me.

7294,Dreaming of a Straight Girl Christmas,"I've been friends with a woman for a few months, and over the past 2 months, our friendship has seemingly become closer to the point that a couple of weeks ago, we were up until **3 am texting/flirting (she made a joke about how she ""does herself"" and wanted initially for us to forget the conversation), and I admitted I was thinking about being with her** in that moment, and she seemed fine with the fact that I'd said that.

I **tried to confront her** about the convo via text, and she **apologized** and told me that **most of what she said was about a guy.** When I said to her, ""but not all of what you said was..."", she quipped with, ""I don't recall lol"". I let it go until she was asking me to listen to her rant about her ""boyfriend"" who she doesn't call that (she doesn't want to label them) and crying about how she doesn't think she can stay with him.

On Sunday, I **asked her if we could talk one-on-one** (we work at the same place though in different departments). She was fine with talking privately, but **she made it very secretive.** She left work with her boyfriend, and then circled back to meet me elsewhere to talk. We **talked for 3 hours** about things, but I just didn't have the ""balls"" to bring it up. Afterwards, we were texting, and I told her that **I didn't get to say what I wanted**. Then, she said, ""What is the topic? That you thought I was flirting and I didn't think I was?"" I was kinda surprised **she called me out** and had a poor response to that, but we were okay the next day - though she's been seemingly irritated.

**I really need advice on this**. Would a woman tell someone she is interested in about her boyfriend like that? Would she tell that person about a guy or guys she's cheated with or kissed? Would she tell that person that her family likes to tease her about who she's stringing along? Am I making nothing out of all of this?

I’ve been listening to this podcast for the last two years. There’s only three seasons (~30 episodes), but I’ve listened to a lot of the episodes several times over.

The premise of the podcast is a therapist providing couples therapy, and you are listening to the anonymous session. There’s dating couples, married couples, mother and child pairs, etc. 

The podcast isn’t free therapy, but it does provide great insight on how people feel and respond to one another. I feel like I’ve leveled up my empathy points from listening to this podcast.

7312,Anybody a small town queer?,"Just venting and gonna ask for suggestions but like, I’m a small town queer girl. There’s 43k in my entire country which doesn’t sound small but my town and the neighboring two only account for 8.5k.

The last couple attempts to meet women/enby folks have failed miserably. First one turned out to be 16, awkwardly cross that one out. Next one we had no chemistry and they ended up dating my husband instead. Next one was freshly broken up, ghosted me after a couple weeks and is back with their ex now. The one after that turned out to be really mean. Next one turned out to be a second cousin married in (long time estranged side of the family), next one won’t date poly folks, and the most recent one is in a monogamous relationship.

I really don’t have the time or patience to try and meet people in the nearest city, an hour away. I know that sounds lazy but ugh. I’m just so tired of the rural queer experience. I hate feeling like I need to settle or bend over backwards to meet people. It does t help I have super bad anxiety over being a baby gay. I haven’t been with a woman in years, and my last gf and I broke up under messy conditions. I just wish I could find something close and casual but I feel like I’m asking for too much considering my geographic circumstances.

7313,My friends think growing up with homophobes was not “abuse”,"I grew up in a homophobic household and hated my parents for a while. We are middle class, from the outside looking in seems very loving and supportive, but for a long time it wasn’t. Now at 25 my mom and sister support me but no one else does. I left the state at 21 and my friends in my new state were subjected to a “secret twitter” where I went crazy hysterical about how unsupported I felt, how my dad used to gaslight and abuse my mom, how he tried to beat me up as a kid and had a year or two he was super alcoholic. I then got an ED and attempted suicide, all claiming it was due to the lack of family support. I’m home for Xmas and posted a picture with my family. We’ve all been to therapy and talked it through. My friends are pulling an “aha! You lied about the abuse” and it drives me crazy. They’re claiming now that “everyone wants a tragic backstory and to be victimized, you just feel sorry for yourself all the time.” I am a depressed person who is cynical and was worse before, but I’m NOT LYING and sick of having to “prove” I was abused constantly instead of my friends trusting me. Even now at Xmas eve my family is being good and supportive and I almost feel gaslit— “was I lying?” Was I just more sensitive back then? Do I have to “prove” to them that I was abused? Wtf. Just feeling shitty tonight. If my family wants to be back in my life and support me why the hell would I ignore it. My mom and sister have always loved me, my dad was a problem area but got calm and sorry in his elderly state. I’m so sick of “prove it” culture.

7323,I'm so 🤬ing tired of cishet couples (aka unicorn hunters) invading WLW spaces on dating apps.,"Unicorn:  a (usually) bisexual woman who would be willing to have a threesome.

What about where I say ""I'm 1000% gay"" in my profile screams ""I want your husband's dick near me?"" It's absolutely infuriating to have to waste profile space to say I'm monogamous and not interested, only to have it be completely ignored by couples (and men, but that's another issue) that you know have swiped right on you. I live in a major city, and use multiple dating apps, and there is absolutely no escaping it. Not even on HER. You name the app, I've tried it.

I just want to meet a woman and fall in love, but the only way to get there is to first wade through a sea of couples who just want a warm-blooded sex toy. Ethically non-monogamy is a thing. Not my thing, but a thing. I'm all for people fucking as imaginatively as they'd like, but at what cost do you pursue it into WLW spaces? Even when you don't match with these couples (who hasn't been solicited for a threesome by a woman who claimed to be single but suddenly find found herself with ""a sexy man""), it still takes its toll. It's the sense of being hit on by men from afar, or by proxy; an inescapable male gaze. It's the disregard for our sexualities; the tacit invalidation; the objectification; the entitlement. The knowledge that all you are is something to be used and cast aside.

The sheer volume is exhausting, and I'm at my wits end. Nothing I write in my profile will stop it, because couples seem to struggle uniquely with reading comprehension, but what other choice do I have? I'm too anxious to meet women in the wild.

Anyway, as a recap, there's this girl (23) I (21F) met through HER. She liked me first, I saw her in my likes, liked her back, initated a conversation, &amp; we eventually exchange numbers because we both release checking the app for responses was a hassle.

Responses are few &amp; far between, usually days go by before we get back to each other, but only because we are in the thick of our semesters. The conversation is very engaging though, with both of us asking questions to one another. Me, being shy, ask, ""hey would you maybe want to meet up sometime?"" She gives an enthusiastic yes &amp; says she was working up the courage to ask the same. You'd think it'd be a happy ending after that right? LOL

Anyway, she asks for suggestions since she's new to the city, so I suggest a cozy coffee place... &amp; she says it looks cute so we agree to go there! ..But only after finals &amp; the semester is over. Totally get that, of course. Afterwards, I eventually follow-up with a ""but please dont feel pressured to go or anything haha!"" because I have been in situations where someone else took the initiative without me being completely onboard with plans so I just wanted to give her an out yknow? She says ""no!! if you're happy with (coffee place name), then we should definitely go.""

Our last exchange was earlier this month, where she said her semester ended around the 18th, so obviously I was thinking we'd meet up sometime around that date. Additionally, asks if I'll still be around ""later in December"" which I say yes, because I live here haha. Well.. it's Christmas Day now &amp; I still haven't heard anything back! 

Now the question I pose to you lovely people on reddit is.. what's the move?

I reallyyyy don't want to double text &amp; come off as annoying, &amp; I firmly believe messaging is a two-way street. ""If they were truly interested, they would reach out"", has always been my logic. So I'm thinking of just taking the hint &amp; moving on, even though the interest from her was DEFINITELY there. But another part of me, &amp; my friends say, is she's just shy &amp; doesn't know how to pick up where we last left off where yeah, it's a possibility, but seems unlikely. Since we usually got back to each other within 4-5 days (crazy, I know, but it's worked out just fine all these weeks), at first I didn't think too much of it, but this has definitely been the longest time between responses from her. 

TLDR: I have been messaging a sweet girl from HER, we have been talking for a couple MONTHS over text with plans to meet up after the semester. Semester is over, but I have had radio silence on her end ever since.

and it's not like we live in a culture that encourages liberal thinking and acceptance, this shit is ingrained 

So basically i gave up on them both

I just can’t resist watching Bette. There’s something about her that’s so alluring that I only realised it now. The way she looks, her mannerisms and how she speaks. She’s just hot in a different way. I binge watch the early seasons mainly her scenes and skip through the rest.

I also find Tina’s not bad after she split from Bette. She suddenly had this aura which I think was intentional which was why Bette kept on yearning for her when she was supposedly in love with Jody.

They created such a terrible character of Jenny. I hated her scenes. I know we were supposed to hate her but I think some of the writing was just so bad. I find her assistant Adele also bad.

What happens when you love someone? What does one do when they are in love? How did you know you were in love?

There this girl, I want to be closer to her. I really think that she wants it too. 

I give her mixed signals all the time and that's mostly the reason why we aren't closer. I keep giving her the cold shoulder. 

The thing is: I know she wants connect with me and bond. Even though I'm so often cold she tries to reach out to me, big smiles, hugs (even though she told me she doesn't like hugs) kisses on the cheek, she always has me on her mind when I'm distant, and always looks out for me. Calls me to her table if I'm eating alone, brings me along for coffee, if I'm quiet she tries to get me to engage.

But I'm cold so often and so randomly that I can tell that there's only so much she can try to reach out. At this point she's better off spending time with someone else, she knows it. 

How do I reach out without being wierd? I try to always smile at her and not ignore her. I try to sit closer ( so she knows that I'm comfortable) and I make sure to tell her how proud I am whenever she accomplishes something. She appreciates this. But we rarely see each other anymore. 

She gave me her number, but we have never texted, she gave me her Instagram but we only ever like each others posts ((I commented one time on a picture of her art, but selfies? What I'm am I supposed to reply, I see her picture and I'm like damn, she's gorgeous and then read her description and I'm like she's so strong, but I'm not close to her it would be weird to comment sappy things)) .

When my fiancee picked up the gift (I was already out of town at my fame's Christmas) she told me that it was suspiciously book shaped and I hoped that it wouldn't be religious literature. I opened it today and it's a coloring book! I don't personally color but I am a creative person so I think they put a little bit of thought into it. 

There's a lot of work still to do and I don't know if they'll ever be okay with our relationship but I have to be adjacent to then for the rest of my life and I'm so glad that they might be getting used to that.",actuallesbians,1577315990,Briarene,,1,True,2019-12-25

7428,Shifting towards a lesbian 24/7 D/s relationship?,"TL;DR: My domme GF wants to move to a 24/7ish BDSM relationship, I am inclined to agree, but  super sure and slightly afraid that this could jeopardize our relationship so far. Any ideas as to how to talk to her and what to think of that prospect? 

I've (F26) had a conversation with my GF (F27) after Christmas about where our relationship is going and what our plans for next year are. It turns out she wants to substantially increase the dominance/submission aspect of our relationship and I am now trying to digest what that would entail in practice and what my view on this is.

A little backgrounder: We've been together for approx 2 years, living together now, the BDSM spice was always there, I am the sub and she is the domme. I haven't had any previous experience with BDSM prior to the relationship but found myself liking it and following my GF's lead in bed. I don't want to make this too NSFW and describe too much of what we do etc., but let's just say that we've grown pretty experienced when it comes to non-vanilla erotic play, whilst keeping it to a play-level only really. Nevertheless, the top/bottom roles we take up in bed also correspond to our characters, She is very self-confident and decisive, and I am a people pleaser and more pasive when it comes to making decisions both in and out of the relationship. 

For quite sometimes now, the amount of BDSM-themed play has been steadily increasing to a point where it now constitutes basically 100% of our playtime - this is a development driven mainly by my GF, one that I did not mind nor try to hamper in any way. Recently she has started making remarks that as I have now learnt point to her interest in getting D/s out of the bedroom and incorporating it into our daily lives, in more of a 24/7-styled fashion. We just had a conversation over Christmas where she referred to our play as  not too serious, which I think is true in that I have always viewed it as a more of more of a means to an end (my obedience used for our mutual sexual satisfaction) than an end itself (obedience as a value on its own), though I also find it serious in the effort that we both seem to put into it. Anyway, she said that she is feeling like we're not really progressing when it comes to BDSM (even though as I said we're basically only doing BDSM play in bed) and that she feels like it's time to institute some changes to our general, not only sex relationship for 2020. So she is interested in moving to a Mistress-slave relationship (with her as the Mistress and me as the slave obv), and the introduction of some additional rules and etiquette for our everyday life, the way I conduct myself and serve her at home, her control over some aspects of my physiology and sex life (this I am a bit anxious about tbh), and more broadly introducing like a more general hierarchy where she basically has the formal authority to make decisions concerning myself and our relationship, and my role is to obey her commands more or less unquestionably (within reason ofc, she is not a psycho and I trust her ensuring my safety and not getting into something that would expose me to any danger or hazard). She said that depending on my approach and attitude to that idea, we can either proceed in a more formal manner with a long ""ownership"" contract listing all the practices etc., or just stick with safewords (we've been using them since forever, so no change here), but her preference is to just go with the flow and allow her to gradually introduce more and more elements of discipline and control. She has also made it clear that a) this is very important to her and she has developed the idea to try out a fully-fledged BDSM relationship over the recent months; b) she loves me regardless, but it is important to her so she cannot guarantee what will happen if we just stick with business as usual in terms of our relationship; c) if we take this leap, she does intend to take this very seriously and actually impose and deepen that hierarchy as we go on (again she emphasized the ""within reason"" and assured me of her dedication to my physical and mental health and safety, I have no reason not  to trust her on that but I am a bit anxious nonetheless). She is a determined person, so when she says that she treats something seriously, I know she's not making empty promises. 

So what do I think?  She basically asked me that question, and I said I need  some time to think it over, and  I am asking you. Initially I was a bit angry that she had to make it into such a big thing and ""decision"" since we've been doing BDSM since forever, and if I am wearing a collar in sessions I might as well wear it when we're eating breakfast every now and then. The more I thought of it, however, is given the potential impact this may have on our relationhip (like... huge), it is actually very smart and well thought of her to make it into a milestone of sorts, as she emphasized as the Domme she will impose a strict hierarchy and things will not be the same again. This is where I am sad and anxious - I've felt that our relationship so far has been very good and I didn't feel the need to change it so drastically as she just proposed. At the same time, I have to admit I have found myself to be quite naturally submissive and some of the ideas and visions she puts forward resonate with me at least for some time and I am defo curious to try it out. There are also some which she mentions as the target, long-term state which I am afraid of partially becuase of their real-life gravity (like she mentioned that she would be interested in controlling my paycheck, subject to my approval), but I also trust her and i am pretty sure that even within this new relationship status there will be some bargaining going on over the do's and dont's. In any case, I've been surprised by this conversation and her confession even despite the hints that she has been making recently about wanting to expand on BDSM, simply because what she is proposing is so much. 

Still, I love her and want her to be happy in a relationhip with me and so am inclined to agree to some form of the relationship revision that she is proposing. I probably don;t want to sign any contracts in line with her expectations. But, at the same time I think I should make it clear that I am not entirely convinced about this and despite our pretty extensive BDSM experience that would  be my first time in a towards-a-24/7-arrangement (same for her actually) and so I want to have a say in what goes on, at least to some extent (although I dont want to ruin it for her and come across as too needy or disrespectful). Outside of this, we're a good  couple and I am happy with our time so far, we both work similar jobs, have a mutual circle of friends, shared hobbies and are supportive of each other. 

I have done some reading around BDSM since we started engaging in play and so I know all the basics about ""communication is key"", ""safe sane consensual"", safewords etc., but I am curious if any of you girls has any experience doing this kind of relationship bargaining and has any useful tips or perspectives that would be useful to have. Any 24/7 relationships out there? What should I tell her up front? Is there a chance this would ruin our relationship and make it irreparable? Any points/practices I should avoid? For example, has anyone ever experienced a situation where the Dommes and subs expecations concerning the level and intenstity of D/s in everyday life diverged? (I am just a bit afraid of a situation where she likes it so much and I find it hard to ""perform"" as the sub for a long time without stopping while she enjoys it and doesn't want it to stop) 

I feel like there is a lot of material out there but it is dedicated to straight couples mostly, and the context of a queer relationship changes some of the dynamics at play, not only on the level of kink but also on the more mental levels. And from our conversations, what she is after is not just an expansion of kink but basically a more psychological change in our relationship, which sounds quite profound  and a bit scary for me. 

INB4: I will ask a similar question on a BDSM-themed sub at some point, but for now am primarily interested in a wlw perspective on this, hence the choice of subreddit.",actuallesbians,1577327368,carrie_123,,1,True,2019-12-25

7439,I'm so in love.," The truth is I have been feeling a certain way... for a while. This didn't happens spontaneously. It grew...and it flourished over time. 

There are some people you just click with. And those people are rare. But she was one of them. It felt natural. I love talking to her... I love getting to know her. I love learning about her life. I love asking about her time in college, in Philly, her childhood in New York. I love learning about her family and friends. I love hearing her thoughts. The more I learn about her, the deeper I fall.   
I think she's amazing. I love that she's creative. And she's so smart. She's *beautiful ...* and so empathetic. She's an amazing listener, really the BEST. And she's so. fucking. funny. I could spend all day with her ... and the next... and the next. and it still wouldn't be enough.  
My feelings for her are overwhelming at times, and I feel it all the same, maybe even more, at times like these, when we're across the country from each other.  Because I miss her every second.   
But I don't think she loves me the way I love her ... and that's an especially deep and profound pain.   
I don't know if she will ever love me... because she's straight.   I'm THAT stereotype... but I am SO hopelessly in love.     
But I wonder... when she texts me throughout the day. When she asks me what I'm doing. When she sends me memes and pictures from her day.   
When we cuddled on the couch in the cabin with our friends. I know we were drunk, but... even she said that was the best part of the trip. When she put her hand on mine... I'll be thinking about that for a long time.  
Ah. I love her and I have never felt this way about anyone before. I never believed in ""the one"", until her. Being here with family and friends at home, I get tired of people quickly. But I never get tired of her. I know i'm distant with my family here. I'm not completely present. Because I can't stop thinking about her.  
But I also just want her to be happy. She's my best friend. The BEST friend I have eve had. I know she cares about me and that she treasures me. She told me she can't believe how we're just on the same page about everything, and that she's never had a friend like me. I want her to have everything you want in life. And that means a boy... and not me. Recently, she got her heart broken by a boy and it hurt me so much to see her in pain. She has never had a serious relationship and she has told me how insecure she feels about boys, how they always want to fuck her but never want to be her boyfriend. I don't get it at all. I wish I could be that person for her.  
 At the end of the day, I could not bare the thought of her not being in my life. I would never do anything to jeopardize our friendship... and so I will keep my feelings to myself. And it hurts so much.",actuallesbians,1577330802,throaway122519,,1,True,2019-12-25

7444,Coming out to my homophobic mother,"
TW- abuse, suicide 

Hi,

So I’m really scared. In 12 hours or so I’ll be coming out to my mother. I’m financially independent (as in paying all my own bills, working 3 jobs to put myself through school kind of independent). She’s incredibly homophobic and also very abusive. 
When I was 15 she found out I had a girlfriend and I was no longer allowed to have any technology or leave my house except for school and church. I wasn’t even allowed to exercise because I’d “look at other women”. When she found out I was still gay after all of this she sent me to a Christian counselor for what she thought was conversion therapy. Also, she was a teacher at my tiny high school. She instructed the administrators to give me derogatory marks if I even hugged a girl. (Not a joke).  Physical altercations where she would slap me, throw me to the ground, and scream in my face that I made her want to kill herself happened about ever few days. I didn’t know what to do so I told her I wasn’t gay anymore so I could at least leave the house to run. I’ve kept this up for about 4 years because she told me if I “chose to be gay” after high school she wouldn’t let me use her tax returns on my FAFSA. After doing research, I learned that without a parents tax information on FAFSA there’s really nothing they can do for you to help with school expenses if they are still alive. I’m in my last semester of college and have already accepted financial aid using her tax info for my current FAFSA. I also have 3 siblings, and two of them know and support me fully. I just can’t keep lying. This has created severe issues with anxiety and depression. I need advice. How do I approach this?",actuallesbians,1577332142,mrhous2016,,1,True,2019-12-25

I met the most amazing girl. She’s stupidly beautiful, she loves to dance, she’s an aspiring playwright that I actually believe in, she’s just incredible. And she’s patient with me. 

She wanted to kiss me at a bar mere hours after we met and I froze up. She said she wanted to go somewhere private and I could feel myself leaving my body but she held my hand and took me outside to smoke. she didn’t say anything at all, didn’t press me about it, but she wouldn’t let go of my hand.

I assume she is straight because she only ever talks about guys. The only suspicion I have is when she was drunk and casually mentioned how she ate out her friend for a moment (while drunk) because she wanted to try it.

7453,New girlfriend seems to be a little too comfortable with her body for me / Sorry this is very detailed,"**NSFW** 

**CW: graphic descriptions/sexual stuff**

 I’m with a new girl, she’s wonderful, funny, adorable, perfect body, perfect heart, cares about me and treats me perfectly, basically the whole package. We had a few issues with her lack of communication when it came to sex in the beginning of our relationship, and she was insecure about her body for NO reason at all because she looks incredible, but we worked trough it and the sex is much better and more fun now and she doesn’t hide her body anymore. jackpot! 

of course there’s a big *buuuut* now. she’s a baby butch that didn’t grew up on girly magazines that thought her to hate her body. she still learned to not like how she looked but she missed the lessons about the specifics. y’all remember the big deal about eating pineapples before a date? how no guy would ever like you if you had a single hair somewhere on your thigh? the whole crazy trend about bleached assholes? my girlfriend doesn’t. she’s 24 and she managed to get trough life without knowing about those things. good for her!!

she also always tells me that she’s been inexperienced (sexually) before she met me, she was in a long term relationship with a woman before but her ex still
Lived at home and idk any details but from what I’ve seen and from how our was life was at the beginning I’m pretty sure they didn’t really do a lot of sexual stuff. 

I’m a femme and I’m a fucking stereotype. I was one of the popular girls at school, i played volleyball and did ballet. I thought I was straight and I guess, in a stupid attempt to make up for not liking the guys I’ve dated as much as they liked me, I objectified/sexualized myself like someone was paying me to. Waxing, bleaching, tweezing, tanning, special creams and lotions for different body parts, you name it, I did it. Unsurprisingly I’ve also developed an eating disorder when I was 13. I never liked my body, it never felt perfect enough. But it’s gotten a lot better. I’m in recovery for my eating disorder, I don’t count any calories, I don’t weigh myself, I‘m okay-ish with my body overall. I still feel anxious about imperfections on my body but it’s at a somewhat normal level I think. I am okay with unshaved legs and nowadays I only use bleach to get stains out of white clothes. 

I’m genuinely glad my girlfriend never went trough a phase like this. Really. That’s why I don’t want to bring this up to her. I am super scared of accidentally making her feel like I felt and scarring her forever. She’s already always intimated by me (for no reason because I am seriously speechless whenever I see her body because she is literally perfect) while I’m always hyping her up and celebrating everything about her body. I feel like pointing out stuff I don’t enjoy would ruin all the progress and her ego. 

But she’s kind of.. a slob. I’m not obsessed with being clean. I can very easily wear the same pair of jeans for a week. I am fine with food stains on my sweat pants when I’m chilling at home. I don’t care about showering or washing my hair when I’m not seeing anyone that day. But there are things that I just do out of habit. I floss twice a day, I use a bidet, etc. And when I’m with someone I take extra good care to make sure I smell nice and am ready to have sex without having to worry about any smells or anything. 

My girlfriend doesn’t think about this at all. She never flosses. Literally never. She likes making out in the morning though which I find gross enough at it is but I’m willing to drop this perfectionist obsession but making out with someone who never flosses before they have brushed their teeth? I just *can’t*

She is fine with not showering even once when I spend the entire weekend with her, because “we’re just sitting on the couch anyway”. (Asking her to join me in the shower doesn’t work and she never gets any of my hints). She very much enjoys spontaneous sex though. She’s definitely a bottom and I dig that but it also means that I’m the one who’s going down the most and I started dreading sex. Look, I’m not being mean or expect too much, I think. I don’t care about body hair, I think it’s cool how she doesn’t care about morning breath, I love that she is so enthusiastic about sex that she never thinks about being prepared or not before we start. 

But I can’t deal with the smell/taste sometimes. Most of the times. It wasn’t this bad before, but the longer we’ve been together the worse it’s getting, I guess because we spend more time at home and cook more (she puts garlic and onions into everything and she doesn’t drink enough water and anyway, you know what this means), and she doesn’t change her clothes or showers as often as she would if we went out more. I’ve seen bits of toilet paper  stuck on her while I was eating her out - twice. 
I know she rarely remembers to wash her hands after using the bathroom. 
I’ve seen her put on socks she wore the day before in the morning, and not just once. Because when you’ve just been at home you didn’t sweat so it’s like they’re new, she says. All these things really gross me out. 
She is fine with putting her underwear back on after we had sex and just wearing it - after, you know, we had some foreplay while she was still dressed and stuff. She changes her bed sheets like once a month, but only because of me, when she’s alone and doesn’t have sex in her bed she washes the sheets even less. 

I don’t know what to do. I can’t think of a way to let her know she needs to take care of those things. I don’t want to make her paranoid about her bodily fluids. I don’t want her to feel like I did, you know?

I am considering ending things with her though because now that I’ve already felt so disgusted it’s super hard for me to not get crazy over it in my head. I don’t even enjoy cuddling with her anymore. I still go down on her and after a while it’s always okay so I just try to ignore the first few minutes but that’s not how it’s supposed to be. And since she’s a little bit of a pillow princess (which is totally fine by me!!!!! I like being the more active part!!!) it’s hard to enjoy myself the way I usually do when I have sex with bottoms lol. idk.


Ahhhh fuck, I know this is a throwaway but I still feel guilty as fuck because I talked about her like this. I want y’all to know that she’s precious and the nicest, most caring girl I’ve ever dated. She’s beautiful and her face is adorable. She’s the cutest butch I’ve ever seen and I love when the tries to act all tough and cool despite being this tiny baby faced person. I love seeing her in sweatpants and hoodies, I love seeing her naked, I love being with her. She’s just...not on the same hygiene level as me.

7456,Seeking advice- dating again after an unhealthy relationship,"Sorry for bringing down the mood a bit-

My first relationship was very unhealthy bordering on abusive, and even though it's been 2 years since we broke up it still really affects me. Well call this girl Sally. I dated one other girl since then, lets call her Martha, but we broke up for a lot of reasons but one of them was because I was still dealing with the trauma of my first relationship and she felt rejected or hurt somehow by that.  (No hard feelings) anyways after that I decided that I was done with dating for a while.  But six months out I decided I would like to get back in the dating saddle.  However like I said my first relationship still sometimes triggers episodes of depression and anxiety.  First of all, I'm afraid that whoever I start dating I will constantly compare in my mind to Sally, and be paranoid about power dynamics so it ruins both our experience of the relationship.  Second of all, I'm afraid that it's unfair to anyone for me to date them, considering how much my relationship with Sally still affects me.  I DO NOT have any feelings for Sally and I wish I never had to see or think about her ever again.  One part of me thinks it's okay to still be experiencing the affects of trauma a couple years out, and i should be able to still have meaningful romantic relationships, which include being able to go to them when I am depressed or anxious about Sally.  (Again I have no lingering romantic feelings for sally, but her actions and our relationship still upset me.)  However, seeing how it affected Martha, a very sweet and kind woman, I reconsider.  I dont want to hurt someone else like I hurt her.  Thoughts?

Tldr:  I got out of a bordering on abusive relationship almost 2 years ago but it still upsets me every once in a while.  Should I wait until I'm completely over it before looking to seriously date again?",actuallesbians,1577339429,raldenr,,1,True,2019-12-26

That I could date women too. That I've known since I was 12 and that I've known for more than half my life. She said that it'd be hard for her, but that she wondered when I was younger, ""Is mija gay?""

7462,Looking for resources for dealing with a very homophobic family,"First of all, I want to say that I am safe and okay for now. I am closeted to my parents and sister, but out to everyone else in my life.  
Some background on the situation: my mom is a born-again evangelical and my dad just hates gay people? Growing up was really toxic for me because I kind of always? knew I was queer and grew up walking on eggshells. I tried to come out when I was sixteen or so but my mom said things like “if I ever had a gay child I’d kill it” and I was afraid I’d be sent away or something. 
I ended up coming out to my friends and colleagues when I was 24. I’ve had a hard time dating because of my current situation with my parents. I’m still kind of dependent on them because I was working on a presidential campaign that dropped out so I’m at home and unemployed.   
I had a therapist before the campaign and she basically said I shouldn’t worry about any of this stuff until I have to come out to my parents. Well, the ticking time bomb of them never talking to me again and cutting me off is stressful. Plus, they say super homophobic stuff multiple times a day and it wears on my soul. Sometimes it make me feel very sad. I try to talk to my friends but they’re all like “that sucks. my parents like gay people!” and it’s not helpful. I think a lot of times they don’t know what to say and so they don’t respond to me to change the subject and it makes me feel crazy. 
I have nobody in my life that I can relate to and it’s isolating? It makes me feel alone and the holidays have been especially tough. Thanks.",actuallesbians,1577342926,invisiblesm0ke,,1,True,2019-12-26

7469,I (40F) Am in Love with My Friend (46F) and We Are Both Married with Three Kids Each,"I   am an until-now straight female. I have a truly wonderful family but have no interest in sex with my husband or any interest in penises at all. I kind of hate them, actually, and I don't know why. I have never had feelings for a woman before, but have always wondered what it would be like to be with one. Now, I am becoming very close to a woman who is  a lot like me. I have longed for a best friend for a long, long, long time and we are heading in that direction but I have fallen in love with her. I am fantasizing about her every night. In detail. She is not  even  especially pretty--I just really like her.

I am terribly sad about this. I am tempted to drop hints but it would be so wrong to do so. I can't imagine cheating on my husband with a man but I want her so badly and sometimes I tell myself that it wouldn't  matter as much since she's a woman ... or at least we could more easily  get  away with it. I could potential devastate her whole life and mine  or  just humiliate myself.

First question: How do I get over her?

Second question: Does anyone think my feelings will go away on their own?

Third question: Can I be true friends with someone I'm in love with if the feelings don't go away?

Fourth question: Am I bisexual or gay or am I just confusing my desire for a best girlfriend with sexual attraction because my desire to be close to her is so strong? I have only had one other best friend but tons of girlfriends and I have never had a ""Hey, I want her"" thought about any of them.

She doesn’t like penetrative sex, and when I try and talk about other options for sex she’s kinda like “shrug, idk” type thing.

A bit of foreplay and then we take turns on going down on each other and that’s it.
Even if I try and say ‘buy a strap and bang me on the kitchen sink’ she won’t get the hint, even if we explicitly talk about it and she’s like ‘okay I will’.

I just find guys so hard to relate to and I don’t think I want to be in a relationship with a guy again. But I also still am fooling around with a guy so I do like the sex aspect. I’ve spoke to 2 different girls that I’ve met on reddit and always find it really exciting, a lot more than when I’m with a guy. A lot of people have been asking me if I’m bi, or lesbian, and I don’t know what to say?

Our conversations always lead to us laughing and teasing each other.

(not to say that she doesn't look me in the eye, she actually holds eye contact for much longer than normal). There are certain instances in which we're sitting in silence and she just gazes into my eyes and I do the same and it feels so strangely pleasant. Sometimes she'd even touch my shoulder or my elbow, simply for the sake of touching. A couple of days ago, I hesitantly came out to her, and guess what? She says she ""kinda suspected it anyway"" and I go all ""what??? how???"" and she goes ""I have a strong gaydar.""

I have a basic understanding of Russian so we like to make jokes about both Russian language and Norwegian(a language I speak). We’re rather close already and I have drawn her things before(the last thing I drew for her was a bear with a present since her favorite animal is a bear!). The topic of sexuality has come up before and she knows I’m a lesbian but has never mentioned her own sexuality and is pretty dismissive of the topic. I don’t know if this is because she’s questioning, just uncomfortable talking about it, or has been hearing homophobic things from her parents(homophobia is not uncommon in Russia). She has never chastised me for it or anything, though, and seems very comfortable with being around me and affectionate contact(I’m v e r y affectionate with friends regardless of gender, as long as they’re comfortable). I hope all will go well with her, and I’m trying to meet up with her over this winter break. She wanted to sleepover at my place but her parents are very strict. Hopefully we can end up going shopping or out to eat soon, I’m just waiting until a bit longer after Christmas to ask!

(TL/DR: I’m in love with a Russian)

7499,So. How is tinder for wlw?,"For context, I'm bi and truly accepted that about a year ago, but haven't been interested in dating for a long time. I'm getting out of that mindset now and am soo into the idea of dating a girl (it would be my first time!). I'm in my early 20's in a very LGBT-dense area, so I'm optimistic about the idea. 

So the actual question: how is Tinder, or Bumble or whatever, for wlw? I was on Tinder years ago when I thought I was straight and had some terrible experiences with college-aged hetero dudes, which has definitely tinted my view of dating apps. But my friends tell me it's much easier trying to find a girl on there, maybe because they generally seem more genuine and interested in dating than just hooking up? I want to give it a try but have a lot of anxiety about putting myself back out there, especially cause I'm really not interested in hook ups.

So what do you think? Have you all had worthwhile experiences with this kind of thing? Or do you think girls might be less creepy than guys? Recommendations for other apps?

7503,Lesbian Dating,"Hello!
I’ve been doing some research recently around dating coaches specifically based in the UK for lesbians. I’m finding that this is quite a niche market.
I was talking to some friends recently who were saying that it’s quite difficult to find another lesbian to date. They either use dating apps or hope that someone knows someone. I didn’t realise that this seemed to be the case with a lot of my friends. Some of friends lack confidence in regards to approaching other women. There seems to be some fear around it.
I was hoping that this wonderful subreddit would do me the honour of answering some questions....
1. Do you personally find it difficult to approach another female with the intention to ask them out on a date or for their phone number?
2. Do you find that you lack in confidence? This could relate to any confidence issue that you feel holds you back in relationships or dating?
3. Would you be willing to approach a dating coach specifically lesbian to advise and guide you with any confidence issues and support with dating?

I sincerely appreciate your help in advance and I’m hoping that I can provide some help with my friends and all going well support and guide people in future.",actuallesbians,1576626431,anxi__,,1,True,2019-12-17

A teenager in need of help,After years of thinking my parents wont be accepting and might throw some Christianity bs I think I’ve come to realized that they may bring a bit of religion and discomfort for them may rise for a period of time but will overall end up being okay with it. Well theoretically speaking. I have two amazing parents who love me dearly and I am a closeted lesbian. I have never been actively looking to be in a relationship in high school as it will just cause complications and a bunch of lying. Anyways the inevitable came and I had a crush on my best friend (who my parents adore but think she’s just my best friend) sooner or later we ended up kissing. It was unplanned and I didn’t even know she liked me. I like her so much that I can’t just not be her girlfriend but I feel bad and guilty for lying to my parents. Then there’s a “no dating rule in high school”. Long story short I feel guilty bu refuse to come out as I am not ready and I’d prefer to come out outside of college so I can easily leave my house if I feel uncomfortable with everything. Bad thing is I can see this relationship lasting for a while - like extends to college. This would mean there would be 2 years of lying. I don’t know what to do.

My gf and I have been together for almost a year. I’m in grad school and my gf works full time. I live in a townhouse near my school’s campus with a friend and my gf lives in her parents’ second home. 

I feel like I am not good enough for her in her family’s eyes. I don’t come from a wealthy family. I have never been close to someone whose family owned a second home until I met my gf. Her mom always told her growing up that she needed to marry a Japanese man. I am neither Japanese nor a man, so...

I’ve had a couple of dinners with her family and I am casual friends with her brothers. Her mom has been okay to me in person but weird about me when I’m not around. Her dad says hardly anything/is dominated by her mom. The other day, my gf forgot to turn her phone on silent when she was with her mom and her mom said “I hope you don’t do this to andthiscouldbegood when she’s with her family. This is so rude of her” because I texted her a few times.

Long story short: I am not invited to any Christmas gatherings with her family. Which is okay and I don’t expect an invitation.

7527,how do I get over her when we never even dated?,"I’m 26, came out this year, and I used to work with this married woman and when we met we instantly clicked and became really good friends. At the time I didn’t even know I was gay. And well we were really close, we would hug all the time like ten times a day and we would sometimes jokingly flirt with each other and well after I realized I’m gay I also realized a month later that I’m in love with her. I kinda brushed it off as a crush because I also felt guilty for liking her because she’s married but I guess feelings don’t work that way. And well, she’s definitely not straight, I’m pretty certain she’s bi. Anyway, we saw each other 5 days a week and we hung out together all the time and she even “jokingly” tried to kiss me like twice? And the way we acted around each other... everyone at work used to joke that we’re a married couple and “oh tell me when the wedding is” and stuff like that. 

And then I switched jobs and moved across the country (not because of her, for other reasons), and I thought it’ll be a fresh start and I’ll get over her. But she kept texting me every single day and I kept thinking about her all the time and one night, a few weeks ago, I got drunk and texted her and told her I’m in love with her and I don’t think we should talk for a while so that I can get over her. She was nice about it, and we didn’t text after that but she texted me exactly after a week and I didn’t reply but I started crying and she texted me another week after that and I told her I need time and I’m heartbroken and need to stop thinking about her, and she said she doesn’t want to be the one to hurt me and she stopped after that. 

I thought it’ll get better after cutting contact with her and I was doing fine for the most part last week but this weekend all my feelings came back stronger than ever and I just miss her so much I wanted to call her and talk to her and ask her to come to me...like all these irrational thoughts I shouldn’t be thinking. Also I’m pretty sure she has feelings for me too but I guess it doesn’t matter. But anyway, I keep thinking about her all the time and I can’t concentrate on my work because of it and I don’t know what to do. I don’t think I’ll ever get over her and we were never even together. She’s brilliant and funny and just my type and I know she cares about me a lot, like she’s not sentimental but when I left she made me a scrapbook and basically she treated me really differently than anyone else at work and it always felt like we were more than just friends. So yeah, here I am at midnight typing this all out because I don’t know what to do. How do I get over her? Is it ever even gonna happen?

7539,My lesbian wife..,"Please read. I need help saving my marriage.

I don’t think I would come here today to ask for help but my situation is very different and difficult. I am the husband of a wife who is a lesbian. My wife is from
Ireland and has no family here and we live in Canada. She is fully dependent on me and has no status in Canada because we are in the process of sponsoring her.

 My wife struggles with lots of mental health things and has been in and out of hospitals all her life. In Ireland she had really bad experience with mental health and they didn’t help her. After moving to Canada we found a solid team of doctors she sees every second week. 

She recently started new medication and it made her lose all her long term memories like how we met, our travels and dates. So I am complete stranger to her.  She has always known she was a lesbian and accepted after we got married until then she thought it was a “phase” but she always struggled to do day - day things. She is autistic and has sczhophernia, anxiety and depression. Also lots of other health conditions they prevent her from doing day to day things. I was the only person she has been with and she has known me since she was very young. I developed my life around her. We both did actually and I haven’t spent more then two hours apart in our entire time since we started seriously dating years ago. She has never worked a job and can’t because she can’t even go to the mall alone because she has panic attacks from noise and kids. She is completely dependent on me and I have done online collage and I work full time from home. I feel like only I know how to support her and I learned that from years of experience. Her mother knew she was always different and we always worked together to help her. 

She now feels like because she is a lesbian she in trapped in a marriage with me. She didn’t feel trapped before but was very happy to compromise because she accepted she wasn’t like everyone else and didn’t want to risk leaving me because she couldn’t ever date anyone according to her. (Her new medication has a side effect of memory loss, Zoloft 200mg) she thinks it’s better to have no memories because it only reminds her of trauma from past psych wards. She thinks it’s better to be like this and doesn’t see an issue. She comes here constantly now on this subreddit and compares her self to every one else on here but doesn’t take into account her past and can’t make a rational choice if she isn’t fully there. 

Her doctor knows about memory loss but is away for Christmas and In meanwhile my wife has decide she wants to get up and leave. I can’t tell her what she is like without making her feel small. My wife still at this age sleeps with her disney teddy bear because it makes her feel safe. She believes that all Disney characters are real. I can’t explain to her that she isn’t like everyone else and the world won’t adapt to her but rather she will have to adapt to the world. 

I am not trying to hold her back so we came up with a solution. I be her emotional partner and every few weeks she can see a escort and fulfil her sexual needs. I worry one day she will want the escort idea to be her emotional and sexual needs but what can I do?  I really mean I don’t think I can live without her. I have really done everything for her and she admits when she is really upset that she can’t live without me and thinks it’s best to kill herself then live with this inner conflict. When we were kids we had free time always so we constantly called like I mean 12 hours a day we really spoke for hours and hours and hours about non sense but she had no friends and she was home schooled because of her mental health. So every free moment we were awake we were on the phone. 

Her parents are also really pressuring her and trying to make her see what she doesn’t remember but she only gets angry by looking at happy memories from the past. My wife can’t go out in the world without her noise cancelling head phones.

I must sound like I am holding my wife back but I am really not I just want this to work. So yesterday she saw an escort which was her first experience. She said it was really intimate and she thinks she can live from it week to week. The escort was kind enough to take it really slow and they just did light cuddling and they will go from there next time.

7545,Have you ever felt like an experiment to a bisexual?,"I am a Lesbian (not a fan of labels but they are helpful to explain this). I have recently been dating a newly out Bisexual lady. It was going great at first, I really felt like we clicked on so many levels and we certainly had chemistry and laughed and had so much fun together. Then one day I got a message from her saying she had developed feelings for this guy, we discussed this and she seemed very confused about what she wanted and how she felt about me and that having feelings for this guy had made her question things between us (shes said it wasn't because I'm a woman but I can't help but know in my mind that it has a lot to do with it). I told her politely to sort her head out because I didn't want to be a question mark in her life and to then get in touch when she has, she took a week and then replied that she would like to see me. So we were messaging and she stopped halfway through a conversation. It's now 3 and half weeks later and she replied that she was sorry for not being in touch and that she's was looking at a gift I gave her.

7549,Compulsory heterosexuality confusion?,"I was always on the hunt for “prince charming”. I literally had a checklist in the notes app on my phone of all the qualities a guy had to possess for me to invest in him. I felt like since I had the perfect job and was doing well socially/mentally/emotionally it made a lot of sense for me to find the “perfect guy” to round out my “perfect life” and fulfill some kind of vague prophecy to show the world how on top of things I was. I would become absolutely infatuated with men I deemed perfect. Until, of course, they never lived up to that expectation and I got dissatisfied. Probably not surprisingly, the perfect men I dated always ended up pulling away from me around 3 months in and more than a few of them told me I was too impersonal, too pushy, like a robot. I didn’t really understand what they meant at the time but now it makes perfect sense. It was social climbing and posturing. And what reinforces that idea is that whenever these sham relationships failed, I felt heartbroken not because the relationship had ended but because I believed I didn’t deserve perfection. And even while all of this was going on, I just thought it was an interesting quirk that I was “bisexual” but significantly more emotionally invested in women than men. To be fair, I think there have been some instances in dating men where I was actually attracted to them and in love with them. But now, when I think about starting a new relationship with a man, I'm overwhelmed with this unbearable trapped feeling and I feel repulsed when I think about having sex with a man. I feel like women who are bi don't feel this way about men. So recently I've been tentatively identifying as lesbian. 

However, I still subconsciously pick out men that could be viewed as a “good husband” and just this morning in the shower I felt stressed about having to be resigned to raising kids with a man for the rest of my life. Then I actually burst out laughing because, I DON'T HAVE TO DO THAT ANYMORE. And even now when I'm in a relationship and in love with a woman, sometimes I get sad because I ""realize"" it ""won't be like this when I marry a man"" but then I remember I can marry a woman! For a while I thought I must be the only lesbian that FORGETS she's a lesbian but as I read more about compulsory heterosexuality I'm wondering if I'm not alone. I was raised Catholic and with the expectation of being straight, but I'm out to some of my family now and they seem to be reasonably okay with it if not slightly confused based on my dating history lol. So I guess heterosexuality is just that ingrained in me? Can anyone relate? Will this get easier with time? I’ve mostly dated goldstar lesbians who haven’t had to go through this so I’m just wondering how common this is.

7588,"33F, confused about myself after a trauma","I'm not sure if this is the right place to pose these questions, so if it's not, I'm sorry.  I'm just trying to get a little perspective, and I'll probably cross-post to get a wider response.

I am a 33F.  I suffered a severe trauma 12 years ago when I was gangraped, leaving me with what everyone thought at the time were permanent injuries which would prevent me from being physically intimate ever again.  If you want to have more information, [I have posted something as part of a therapy project here](https://www.reddit.com/r/adultsurvivors/comments/e2ndtf/this_is_the_story_of_my_gang_rape_this_is_a/).  You probably should read it, but be warned it's rather graphic, so maybe you shouldn't...

&amp;#x200B;

So, to why I'm here.  About a year ago, I had several surgeries which have put my body to rights, and they worked.  Since recovering from my surgeries, my sexuality has rather suddenly come back in a big way.  I desire physical gratification ALL THE TIME.

&amp;#x200B;

When I was sexually active before my trauma 12 years ago, I considered myself 100% straight.  I had only been with 1 guy, but it felt right, I was definitely attracted to him, and I never had any thoughts about being with a girl.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, however, I find myself, when I'm being intimate with myself, thinking only about what it would feel like to be touched by a girl and to be with her intimately.  I'm not troubled or conflicted by this, just feeling confused.  In discussing with my therapists, I can clearly and honestly say that I can't imagine being touched intimately by a man after being raped by over a dozen of them.  The thought of being penetrated by anything makes me feel like I am leaning over the cliff of a panic attack (I don't even do it with my own fingers).

&amp;#x200B;

I'm looking/hoping for thoughts, perspectives, anything.  Am I a lesbian?  Am I just thinking about this because I can't imagine being with men anymore?  And if so, regardless, I want to try it.  But I have no idea how to flirt with a girl or tell if she's into me.  It's never crossed my mind before now and I have no reference for it in really any sense.  I know I'm at the talking phase, but it would be nice to talk to someone on here who can tell me what it's like to be touched by a girl.  To be romantic with a girl.  I've only known that with guys, and it's been a long time, and I keep reading that it's so different.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a bit of a shut-in...I don't go out unless it's to the doctors, and having reached a year out from my last surgery, that won't be for another 6 months.  I work for myself, from home, online, in cyber-security, so not many workplace meeting opportunities.

i don't get lonely very often just because of how much i've been focusing on myself and on finding the right treatment combinations, but every now and then i'll be reminded of how much i still can't and in many cases have never been able to do. i'm 20, i have time to get better and live a good life, but for the past decade or so i just dont have the energy for most things. it's very pitiful to hear myself vent so i don't want to go on for too long.

7592,Am I actually gay?,"Since a reasonably young age, I've identified as bisexual but now I think I might be gay.

In school, and after, I have primarily only dated men. I dated one woman at school, but I think that was more due to wanting to date a woman that actually wanted to date her (which I know sounds really bad). I am currently in a relationship with a woman.
I've been doing a lot of self-thought over the last few months about my sexuality as I was never fully satisfied in my relationships with men, especially compared to how I feel in my current relationship. 
My thoughts and realisations:
- I never completely enjoyed sex with men, and never finished (which I thought was something to do with me but I can finish quite easily with my girlfriend)
- I always used to ""convince"" myself that I had crushes on guys. So I would tell myself I liked a guy and then actually get some sort of feelings towards them
- The idea of being with a man in any physical way repulses me
- The idea of a life/future with a man is not something I can see for myself
- The idea of a life/future with a woman is something that I've always wanted but I don't think I've always admitted it
- I have always found women attractive but only sporadically find men attractive

I was having a discussion with my sister about all of this and she said that she thought I was probably gay but too scared to admit it. I have never been embarrassed about my sexuality or my attraction to women but it kind of resonated with me. 
I don't really want to ""come out"" to anyone until I'm sure. Pretty much everyone knows my identity as a bisexual and the fact that I have a girlfriend, so there's also the question of if I even need to come out.
I'm just very confused about the whole thing, and I've been so confident about my sexuality before that it is frustrating me that I'm now not so sure.

If anyone has something that made them realise they were gay or any advice or insight, I would be so so grateful. I just really need some help!",actuallesbians,1576701613,confused-andasleep,,1,True,2019-12-18

7608,I just can’t stop thinking about her! I think she might want me back?? What do you think?,"So I am crazy about this woman that I used to date and be friends with. And we definitely have quite a saga of being on and off.

So we met on Her last year and we immediately connected and we went on like 3 dates in a week, and then out of the blue she texts me telling me she is getting back together with her girlfriend. Even though I only knew her for a week I was pretty sad about it. A week or so later she texts me saying she still wants to be friends with me, and we plan to meet for tea. And we meet up and it’s hard but I accept it because I like her company even if it isn’t romantic. And then New Years rolls around and she says she wants to meet up. We end up meeting up and at midnight she told me she broke up with her girlfriend and she asked if she could kiss me.

So after that we dated for like a month. Things were going pretty good. We weren’t able to meet up a ton because I got sick for a whole week and our work schedules didn’t match, but eventually we met up and she made me dinner at her place. And on this night we started getting a little more physical.

And some background. I am a survivor of sexual assault so I still have, even with women, a very complicated relationship with sex and setting boundaries. She doesn’t know this about me and I felt like it was too early to share. And I decided before going over that I was not going to go past making out because I was afraid to get triggered.

So anyway things are getting pretty hot and heavy, making out and attempting to grind (that’s a whole other question of how to do that). And it starts getting intense and because I am so nervous about telling her I’m not ready I just start laughing uncontrollably and she kept asking “why are you laughing” and I just didn’t know what to say. I think she knew something was up And we ended up stopping to cuddle. During this time, I said stuff like I’m really attracted to you and in the near future I want to have sex with you. I also asked if she was tested recently and we exchanged our last STI testing and if there has been partners since being tested. And then out of being super nervous I asked the dumbest question “What is lesbian virginity?” when I meant to ask how do you define lesbian sex. She was really put off and weirded out about the question and understandably so. She talked about how she didn’t believe in virginity. And then she asked me about “what we are doing?” And because I was leaving for a big trip in just a few months I told her I just wanted something casual and that I was seeing other people. And later after that hella awkward conversation, when I tried to start making out with her again she turned her head to the side and said that she wasn’t feeling it. And I ended up leaving because I felt like she didn’t want me there. But as I’m leaving she still wanted to give me a goodbye kiss.

She texted me the next day saying that she was confused about what she wanted with me and said she needed some time to think. She ended up coming to the conclusion that it’s best we just be friends again. And eventually because she works for the forest service and was leaving to work, our friendship faded out.

So I leave for my trip and on that trip I can’t stop thinking about her and just realize how strong my feelings are for her. So when I get back I find her on Instagram and follow her. She then follows me back. I look at her photos and she ended up getting back together with the same ex she broke up with for me. But later that day I saw her ex on a dating app so I think they may have broken up again. But anyway then a few days later she slides into my DMs saying “I was looking through your photos from your trip and it looks like it was an amazing experience. I am proud of you ❤️” God when I saw that heart, I felt something so strongly in my chest. I don’t know how to interpret it, but I just know even when we were dating she didn’t send me heart emojis. In my personal experience, I only use hearts for my family and really close friends (sometimes I don’t even feel fully comfortable sending it to them) So for me it’s a sign of love but I know everyone has a different interpretation. Anyway I tell her that it was great hearing from her and we talk about what’s going on in our lives. I was hoping she was still going to be in the town we both live in, but then she told me she’s going to be gone for 3 months on a trip, and I felt physical pain in my chest. I was hoping we could rekindle our relationship. I ended our conversation with “If you’re back in town let me know because I would love to see you again and exchange stories ❤️” And she replied with “of course” and a :)

I know I’m just going to sound like another lesbian that fell too hard, but I think this time around it might work out better between us. I have a feeling the reason why she didn’t want to continue dating is because I was leaving anyway and I wasn’t looking for anything serious. But I’m back now and she’s all I want. I plan on staying in the town we both live in for a while. And I’m now ready to really go for something with her. And when she gets back I want to tell her all this. But I’m wondering if I shouldn’t even keep my hopes up. How do you read this situation? Do I need to get over her? Or do you think there is hope to rekindle our relationship?

I’m trying so hard to go out to gay dance nights and date other people to get over her, but my head always goes back to her. If I do need to get over her what should I do to help?",actuallesbians,1576706143,OddEggplant,,1,True,2019-12-18

7610,How long did it take for you to have good sex? Did you have bad first times?,"I've been with a few girls but the sex has never really been good. Well, there was one drunken hookup that was good as far as drunk sex goes (it was my first time doing that and I learned it's really not for me). 

The experience that was the toughest was with a girl I dated a year ago. We had been going out for a couple months but were taking it slow. We did stuff for the first time and when I made her come, she said it was the best orgasm she'd ever had. She didn't really offer to do stuff to me, so I asked and she agreed. She wasn't really listening when I talked about what made me feel good. She kept looking around the room like she was bored and was half-assing the sex stuff. She definitely did not seem interested in making me feel good or even looking at me. I felt so ugly and undesirable and ended up cutting things off shortly after, in part because of that experience with her. 

I've been with one other girl and I think I didn't really feel a connection because we hardly knew each other and had nothing in common. I think she was more interested in experimenting with a girl than being with *me*, so she wasn't super interested finding out what I like, and she wanted to cut it off once we both had finished. 

I guess the point of this post is that I just keep feeling so underwhelmed and disappointed by my experiences, and that discourages me from seeking more. I hear people talk about how their first time just feels so right and they spend all day pleasuring each other. I love looking at girls and imagining myself with them, but what if sex just isn't ever going to be good for me? I'm already 23 too so I feel like I need to get experience ASAP or else I'm going to be so incompetent and undesirable in bed. 

I just want a girl that *wants* to fuck me and wants me to fuck her. So how long did it take for y'all to have good sex (if ever)?",actuallesbians,1576706640,useless_and_confused,,1,True,2019-12-18

7617,Syrian Iraqi lesbian couple in trouble 2 (UPDATE),"UPDATE : 18/12/2019 ——————————————- 

Hello everyone! Thank you so much for the support and information you have given you are truly amazing❤️! After looking into the suggestions and doing some research we have came up to these options. We still can’t guarantee the success of any of them but we actually don’t have any other choice. 

Option 1: Apply to Canada Express Entry based on our skills and English abilities. We can have 430 as a CSR code which is not bad or good in getting accepted. We must submit English and French tests plus University papers in which can take up to few months to achieve but we started working on it. 

Option 2: Go to Ecuador. We can apply for visa to go there. Though they have updated their laws for Syrians and Iraqis last August so I don’t know for how long we are going to stay or if we are allowed to get a job after we arrive. If there is anyone who has more information about Ecuador let us know.

Option 3: Rainbow railroad. We have contacted them and they sent us a reply (idk if it was automatic) they asked to sent us detailed information about us and asking for friend’s confirmations of our relationship. They said they won’t be able to give support but they will assign a case worker to us who can help us work the best options of our resources.

All of this is very stressful I am not going to lie. We will have to start letting go of our stuff the next month or so. I have a last shot at my residency in Turkey within two-three weeks from now and at this stage It is kinda like gambling. My partner is being let off from her company because Turkish government refused to renew her work permit, and the company knows that she and her co-workers (Syrians ) are about to face the unknown and probably getting kicked out, but do you know what is Ironic about this? Her company is one of those humanitarian companies that provide support to Syrians(their sole purpose is to support Syrians) and they are funded by well known global supporters and Ironically they are letting their Syrian employees go without any support by saying its not our problem! This thing really made us bitter.

I can’t describe the sleepless nights we are having, we still can’t believe that all of this is true,and within each and every day it’s getting scarier. We just want to live in peace. That’s all.",actuallesbians,1576711191,stm98q,,1,True,2019-12-18

7656,how do i convince my mom to meet my gf/let her come over for a few days?,"hey, i’m meg and i’m a 19 year old bisexual college student. a few of months ago i met this beautiful girl at college, who’s named jess, and i am so happy with her. 

however, i have a problem: my mom. ever since i came out to my mom 4 years ago, she’s struggled a lot with the idea of it and hasn’t been 100% supportive of me. she isn’t purposefully mean towards me about it, she just genuinely does not understand how i can like both guys and girls, why i “chose” to be this way, why it has caused me to drift from christianity (my mom is hella christian) and why can’t i just “ignore” it. she’s trying her best to understand, which i really appreciate and i’m very likely, but i’ve found that i can’t rush into things related to my sexuality (like telling her i’m going to pride, telling her that i have lgbtq friends, etc) or else she’ll freak out.

so here’s my situation: my girlfriend, jess, lives out of state for college and i live in state. for a better picture, i love a 2.5 hour drive away from college and she lives a 4 hour flight away. so our J-term has just started, and jess thought that she had all of her travel plans figured out for going home and coming back to college. however, her travel plans for coming back to college just fell through, and she needs a place to stay in the state where i live/our college is. she doesn’t have the money for a hotel, and the area where she is flying in isn’t the safest and she doesn’t know that city well at all. so basically, her best/only option would be to stay with me for those last couple of nights of J-term since i only like a half hour away from the airport she is flying into. 

i would love her to stay over at my family’s house for a couple of nights, but i’m very anxious to ask my mom about having her stay over. my mom knows that i’m dating jess (and she’s not really ok with it), but she doesn’t realize how serious of a relationship we are in. my mom is normally very welcoming with letting my friends stay over, but i think that she is going to be very weirded out and not ok with my girlfriend staying over. even though i’m literally an angel daughter and have never gotten into trouble, my mom has trust issues with me, so that makes things even more difficult.

how can i ask my mom to let my girlfriend stay at the house for a couple days? what are some points that i should bring up? also, if jess does stay with us, what are some good first impression tips to make my mom comfortable with her and like her? please help, thank you so much!!",actuallesbians,1576733378,angstyactivist,,1,True,2019-12-19

7659,Just came out to my parents,"And it was just as bad as i imagined it. I’m 26 and have known i was gay since 13. But, because i come from a very religious family I’ve kept it hidden. I dated men, slept with them, and hated myself every day. I was lonely, depressed, sad, and felt like i was missing something..

Until i met my girlfriend. She’s amazing, funny, kind, beautiful, sweet, and has shown me more love than any member of my family ever has. She’s shown me real love. And that let me know she was worth fighting for.

So, I’ve been asked to move out by January 7th. I’m not welcome to any Christmas from any side of the family. And my mom just hugged me for the last time and said she didn’t want to see me anymore. Mind you my birthday was last week and they couldn’t be bothered with me. I’m also an only child. 

I’ve read coming out stories on here hundreds of times and I’d hoped like hell my story would end the same. With love and accepting if not understanding. But i received none of that. I don’t even want to get into what my dad said. 

I’m sorry for this sad post. I just..i guess needed to cry somewhere and let it out and you guys were my first thought.",actuallesbians,1576734049,SadGayThrowaway5739,,1,True,2019-12-19

I was 11/12 when I seen Kate in Young Americans (this was before The L Word) and Holy Christ on a crabcake was I instantly smitten,  I had started to have an inkling I may be a tad gay, well she cemented the fact I was more than a lil gay. In due course  I came across her character Shane in The L Word, the term ""moister than an oyster"" kinda reflects my raging obsession. 

However, The L Word ended. I got busy, found love, life stuff. Then.... Generation Q. I declared out loud to my other half that after 10 years I was sure I would be fine to watch Generation Q and not get a raging wide-on. Oh how naive and very, very stupid of me.

I really enjoy the stuff on r/wholesomeyuri but again, art in a western style isn't especially welcome there. Any recommendations, ladies?

And before anyone mentions other platforms, I do post on other websites!

7665,Vaginas - Does it matter what they look like to you?,"I write this because I'm a little self-conscious. I've been with 2 guys prior to coming out many years ago. Both of them seemed to have loved my bigger labia.

I've been with a few women since, and it's been just fine sexually, usually. However, my two most recent exes... They were both weirded out by how my vagina looked. ""I've never seen one like that"", among other comments. One has the perfect ""porn"" vagina while the other has the smallest labia ""innie"" vagina. Now I've seen my fair share of vaginas, and while they all looked different, more of them had inner labias sticking out than not. So I finally felt reassured. I've never felt ""grossed out"" or anything by any vagina. I love them all.

It wasn't until both of them stopped going down on me that I lost all my confidence. The one before my last ex, I've learned that she just didn't like going down on girls in general. However my ex, who's a very masculine woman and loved to go down on women, maybe did.... Twice in our one year relationship? (While I always went down on her.)

7673,Closeted lonely demisexual bisexual,"I'm taking a break from college so I'm back home trying to figure some stuff out. I came out to 3 of my close friends in college and only one friend back at home. I haven't come out to anyone in my family. So its a little frustrating because i don't have many people at home to talk to about dating n stuff.
Ever since i realized I'm bisexual i really want to experience being with another girl. I'm not into hook ups but i just want to go on cute dates and do romantic stuff. I've tried dating apps a but nothing really seems to be going anywhere. Alot of women on these dating apps are so slow to reply! I hope I'm not sounding desperate but damn we can't even have a decent convo because they take hours or days to come up with a one word reply. 
I know people would say i should try going out and meeting other women but the only place i can think of to meet gay or bi women to talk to and hang out with are clubs. And I'm not much of a club person. I feel like it'll be just me sitting uncomfortably at the bar by myself because I'm super shy and never picked up other women before. I also realize if i get a girlfriend I'd have to tell my mom eventually because i live with her. But I'm just still scared to come out to my family. I've come to terms with being bisexual within the past year but I'm still self conscious about it. Sorry if this post seems all over the place.

I've been in a weird place and was just hoping to get some information/tips/tricks/tacos/etc. 

I'm 30 and happily married for 4 years. We bought a house this year and I've felt like an emotional wreck shortly after. Everything is ""fine enough"" but not really how I want my life to be. So I have been in thinking mode and realize a few things. I've paired down what's important to me and then realized I have no way to deal with those things. See, my wife and I live in a small-minded town, so we don't have many options for friends. Our families are messes and thankfully not terribly close, so we have no real support. I'm not sure how to deal with things like my family during the holidays anymore, or even just my mental state. *(I'm not suicidal or anything, just overwhelmed with anxiety &amp; some sadness.)*

So yeah, I was just wondering if anyone had some advice for the areas I'm struggling in:

* Dealing with family during the holidays
* Managing finances while stressed
* Coping with lonely feelings in a town that's not exactly accepting
* Struggles with art as a gay artist
* Cheap home improvement ideas

I know I'm covering some random areas, but anything would be helpful. I picked these points as they came up more often when I was journaling and trying to sort it out on my own. I keep thinking about it all like a video game. I just need to figure out how to level up and complete this quest.

7748,"[cw: break ups, age gaps, money] - should i stay with my partner?","Hello, 

I am a 23 year old woman in a relationship with a woman who is 52. We've been together for nearly 2 years. 

It started off gorgeously - we have a lot in common personality-wise and can spend hours together doing not much at all. Our families have met and everyone is on good terms abt the whole thing. 

She lives in the U.S, I live in the UK. We are in a long distance r'ship but will be able to close the gap once my Visa is approved. She visits me every 2 or 3 months. 

She earns a lot more money than I do. A lot more. And she helps me financially which has been in good faith so far, and has meant that I've been able to pursue my dream career without accruing a lot of debt. 

Naturally, this has led to a sort of strange relationship between us in which she can so easily foot the bills it's led to an unspoken power imbalance.

I no longer receive money from her, but she will often send expensive gifts to my place even though I am pretty skint. 

She's also getting a lot older physically and I feel kind of trapped in the relationship to be honest. I don't find her physically attractive anymore and I've no idea what to do. 

Sorry this post is so chaotic; I have no one in my life I can talk so transparently about this with. Because it's such an unusual relationship I feel the need to perform a kind of exceptionalism to close friends and family when they ask how it is going. 

I want out, basically, but I worry about her growing old and alone, and I also need time to find a better paying job so that the shift doesn't send me into a spiral.

7759,[cw: Transphobia] Looking for advice - should I reach out to my ex?,"So, there's this woman I was in a relationship with about ten years ago. She's a lesbian. I'm a trans woman, but when we were together, I was closeted and very male.

We were together about a year. Our relationship was... a bit more tumultuous than most. And it was a big part of me realizing that I'm trans.

I never told her this though. Instead of doing the right thing and telling her about my feelings, I did the cowardly thing. I abruptly ended the relationship. We haven't spoken since.

I want to reach out to her... but I'm not sure if it is morally right.

I'm wondering, if any of you can imagine being in her position... how would you feel about getting a letter like this:

---

Hi,

This is about as out of the blue as it gets, and I know people contacting their ex is weird, at best.

I'll warn you right now that this is cake-taking levels of weird. If noping out of interacting with me is the best choice for you, I respect that. Below is some blank space before the actual message.

I'm transgender.

That's probably a bit hard to believe. Ten years ago, I was equal parts clueless, in denial, and honestly also transphobic.

Before I met you, I didn't really know that transgender was a thing I could be. I spent a lot of time wishing I were a girl/woman, but had no self-awareness of what that implied.

One day, shortly after we'd first met, you told me: ""You have pretty eyelashes."" To me that was a very female-gendered compliment, and it made me unreasonably happy.

I enjoyed feeling close to you... but it was complicated. I really hated my libido. It controlled me, and made me feel unable to be intimate the way I wanted to be. I realized the other half of the equation: I didn't want to be a man.

When I visited you in [redacted], I knew the truth about myself. I really wanted to tell you. But I was ashamed. I couldn't open up.

So I instead told myself: ""You're tall. You'd never be more than an ugly freak. You can never be a woman."" I gave up on being the person I wanted to be, and ever being in a relationship with someone who saw me as that person. I gave up on life. There was no future where I could ever see myself being happy.

I feel dumb for not telling you then, I feel dumb for telling you now, and I'd feel dumb for never telling you. I am dumb. Very, very dumb.

I'm also ashamed, for being too afraid to tell you, and for ending things the way I did. You deserved better than that, and I'm sorry. There are other things I regret during our time together, mistakes that I made. But not telling you how I felt is the greatest regret of my life.

I don't expect anything from you, and I honestly can't even imagine your reaction.

I'm glad to see that you seem to be doing well. I'm sorry if it was selfish of me to dredge up the past, but I needed to let it out.

I also thought that maybe you deserved to know. Make of it what you will.

Yours truly, and only ten years late,  
[redacted]

Should I send it?

At the begin of October I was getting the dating vibes again and started to install Tinder and Lexa.. All the women I was interested in where living far away. I'm done with the driving, so after some weeks I uninstalled the datingstuff.
  
Last month I organised my meetup again and she attended. We talked and during 3 hours we reconnected again. She's such a nice and lovely lady. We had too much to drink and ""it"" happend.  
  
We are taking it slow, being damaged by previous relations we really want to get to know each other before making the jump. We've been talking for hours on the phone. She makes me laugh. We discussed difficult parts of our lives. Next week I'll see her again after 4 weeks at x-mas night party (even though she lives just a 15 min drive away). I'm a bit excited to see her again, I hope we really have a thing there and it's mutual.",actuallesbians,1576821199,Breros,just being myself,1,True,2019-12-20

7789,Think I'm in a toxic relationship...,"So I've come to terms with the fact that I'm probably in a very toxic relationship. 

Unfortunately I'm living with my girlfriend for the next semester but I really don't care either way because I have a lot of other things going well on my life. Just got my dream job, changed my major to something I love, about to graduate. 

Every time I try and bring up concerns she invalidates them or responds overly emotionally and ends up changing the dynamic of the conversation so I always feel like I'm the bad guy who should be chastised (pretty sure this is gaslighting). I've come from a long history of abuse and have really mentally trained myself to recognize and prevent toxic/abusive behavior in myself before it can even happen because I know how shitty it is to be on the receiving end. That's not to say I'm faultless or anything, but I really make a conscious effort to be healthy and I feel like it works.

I don't know how to get out of this relationship because every time I've tried, I've gotten roped back into it and I also feel like she might self harm or worse if I leave her. This has tainted my whole view on relationships and I honestly never wanna be in a long term relationship again. How do I get out of this relationship because I know that's the healthiest option for myself, knowing that she might hurt herself if I take this action?",actuallesbians,1576825480,whackali,,1,True,2019-12-20

Simply called Soldier and Healer, the story is about just that. Set in a different world then our own, two nations are at war, the Rhodinites and Argouls. The Rhodinites are said to have come from a bloodline of demons, their blood mixing with humans to become the perfect killing machines. The Argouls have a vast knowledge of magi, allowing them to have power over the rest of the world. The two nations have been at war for centuries with no sign of stopping. When Soldier, a refugee Rhodinite, joins the Argoul army, she meets Healer, a snarky but talented medic. Soldier is fascinated by magic, so Healer takes her under her wing as an apprentice. This one will mainly be a drama.

However, kindly enough, all us homosexuals will be smited first by the gods, seemingly a la sodom and gomorrah- however apparently saved from the oncoming disease/explosion/other horrific suffering.

she knows i like someone because i accidentally tweeted about it on the wrong account (so she saw it...).... i havent told her who it is but when she asks me i get so so nervous..

I talked to her about it in August and we came to a mutual agreement that she’s gonna stay and we would hangout, but we’re just not going to be affectionate like we used to be for a bit. Everything started to feel better after about a week (maybe week and a half) and we eventually began being affection again. about mid-November, my feelings started to fade again.

Fast forward to summer 2018 i was so depressed from not being able to be open about my relationship which was about close to 6 years going strong i tried to take my life and while i was waiting to get admitted in, my parents showed up  asking me why I did this and I finally told them that it's because I'm a lesbian and I couldnt handle not being accepted. When I was let out me and my dad had a short talk basically him telling me that I have to tell my entire fam (they all suck so I dont care if they dont accept me).

Now almost ending the year I have another update. My mom talked to me yesterday about how her and my dad talk about my sexual orientation a lot and she let me know that she doesnt care if I like girls, she doesnt care who I end up with as long as I'm happy and that she let my dad know that if anyone in the family said something rude to me about it (when they do finally find out) she would tell them off and doesnt care if they hate her too and she said that my dad agreed. 

I cried so much after that because I know it's hard for my dad to accept me but I'm glad hes slowly coming around and I love the fact that my mom is being supportive!

My relationship turned 7 years a few months ago and in February of 2020 I will be finally telling my parents about my girlfriend and I'm super nervous but I'm ready to stop hiding, I'm ready to finally stop worrying if someone sees me in public holding my gfs hand or even just being with her in public .

7833,LDR (like really long distance) and I need opinions,"Okay so, I’m going to get the important stuff out of the way. 

I am very much in love with my partner (nb), we met almost a year ago and have been together for six months. We’re in an open relationship so the issue isn’t about sex or intimacy or whatever. 

We met in the city that we both used to live in and then we both moved away as we both had no plans on staying in that city for longer. 

Since we’ve been together, we’ve met almost every month in a different country, but it’s always a vacation obviously because it’s not where we’re living so it’s not like everyday situations and normal life, which I really crave. 

The thing is, there is no foreseeable endpoint for the long distance. I am personally in a really defining moment in my life, and I moved to where I live now because I think it’s really important for me. On the other hand, they are willing to move to where I live but I don’t think it’s a very promising location for them (career wise, with regards to safety (they’re masc presenting I’m not), and they would be putting in a lot more effort than me living in this city as they’re not from the country AND homosexuality is illegal in said country. 

Obviously I want to be close to them but at the same time I really really don’t want them to be making this huge sacrifice in their personal life for a romantic relationship. I feel super conflicted, and I feel that if I support them moving I would be legit a fucking asshole because I want the best for them and I don’t feel like that situation would be the best for them. They feel v different about this and they feel like they’re fully willing to give it a shot and test it out basically. They don’t feel like they’d be missing out on many opportunities, and that they can find something they like where I live. Also they’ve said that it’s not worth it for them to chase a hypothetical opportunity rather than move to my city and be closer to me. 

I feel like them making that big of a sacrifice is unfair, even if they want to be making it there’s an imbalance. + I would be living rent free in my apartment, and they would be renting their own. 

At the same time - I cannot explain how much I value and care for this person it’s insane. I love having them in my life and them being closer to me would be a fucking dream. I miss them allllll the time and I hate not having the opportunity to just get dressed and get in my car and go see them.

Said social butterfly friend thinks everyone wants to fuck her and had made it known in the past that she wanted “more”. I’m not attracted to her in anyway. But I delight in her company. She’s hilarious. Anyways, her girlfriend is very territorial. Quiet but hawklike in her presence. And now it’s so awkward. On top of it there’s these new women that have joined that club that are straight and think that because a few of us are lesbian that we’re automatically attracted to every breathing female. A few of them have hit on me and aired it out that they’d love to “play” and “experiment”, to the point of not leaving me alone when I try to do something out of the group in the get together.

7842,How do I get over a 14 months long crush on a (most likely) straight colleague?,"This is way longer than I would like, even after editing so here is my 

TDLR; I have liked this close colleague who's most likely straight for 14 months. Do I ask her out and possibly commit social suicide or is there any other way to get over her? Please help.

I really like this girl at work and I think she likes me, as a person. If you recognize my user you might recall a few comments I made about her already. Particularly about how she accepted my invitation to a meeting room I was using last year, she hugged me and held me by the waist during a company picture. She generally likes to talk to me. I also wrote about the fact of having verified she's straight. That was a lie, but I wish it wasn't, it would be easier.

I thought I would just stop thinking about her after a while since I don't see her that often (we're consultants and usually work at our respective clients, except on Friday when we come to HQ) but I've now had an active crush situation for 14 months. It can walk and talk by now.

We have never worked on the same project but it could happen. We're in the same subgroup of our department, she's one of my 15-20 ""closest"" colleagues, in terms of hierarchy.

I need to get over it but it seems my soul won't accept that. So I'm thinking of writing her a message in hopes her rejection will snap me out of it.

I have no real info on her romantic life or sexual orientation. We're a very LGBT friendly company where many people wear pins, stickers and lanyards with the Pride colours (company provided). We do a lot for LGBT employees. She's not involved in any of that. I just know she went to Pride and kind of made a point of telling me.

I've tried to hint or suggest dinners or drinks in the past (never just the two of us I went with stuff like ""let's go eat with the girls!"" - most that I got from her was: let me make a Doodle, which she never did).

I really need to get over her. I have wedding plans and holiday plans and a playlist on my Spotify (we share some cultural heritage so it's around that, not like love songs).

But I'm also somewhat afraid of how this could impact our work relationship. And general environment. 

I want to get over her and am at a loss but I don't want to commit social suicide in trying. And of course somewhere down below I still hope she might date me.

I feel like I can't get out of this. What do I do, how do I get over her, how do I ask her out without being creepy. Workplace romance is ok at our company, no rules against it.

7846,We weren’t even official. Why am I so sad?,"I’m sorry everyone I’m not new to reddit but I am new to actually posting. I just didn’t know where else to go. I need to vent. Im sorry if it’s confusing. I just need to get it out I think so please excuse me. I’m just so sad but I can’t cry and I feel so dumb about it.

A bit of background info-I met this girl six months ago. We’ll call her S. S and I quickly became friends, then we started flirting, then sexting, then confiding in each other and opening up to each other about our pasts/fears/ insecurities etc. 

S confided in me that her ex fiancée (We’ll call
her E) was married while they were engaged (S proposed). S told me she regretted it but still hung out with E quite a lot. S told me that E was very controlling and would go though her phone any chance she got and would berate her for what she found. But at the same time would tell her that she was going to leave her husband for her. I told S she didn’t deserve that and if the girl was gonna leave her husband, she would’ve done it by now. 

S told me she was going to change all her passwords and not let E do it anymore. I was proud of her and it seemed like S was happier without that toxicity in her life. 

We were never official but S told me on multiple occasions that she liked me a lot and wanted to move forward with me romantically but wasn’t sure she was ready for another relationship. I completely understood that. So we’ve been taking it slow. I wasn’t sure I was ready either but I shared the feelings she had for me.

We were always flirting and being sweet with each other. Sometimes sexting as well. 

Maybe a month and a half ago things started to get weird. S wouldn’t talk to me as much. They were always with friends. I have her on Facebook so I saw that she was always hanging out with E. And that’s okay. That’s her business. We weren’t official or anything but I was still hurt a bit by the sudden lack of interest.

Then she didn’t talk to me for 4 days. I was sure she was ghosting me. Texted me again and acted like nothing had happened when we always made it a point to always tell each other good morning and good night before.  I asked again if she still had feelings for me and that it was okay if not, I just wanted honesty. She told me she did. 

Cut to this week. She told me she wouldn’t be able to talk for a “couple” days because her “mom needed to use her phone.” I haven’t heard from her in a week. I see her on Facebook with her ex fiancée. E has been thanking her for her “help while her husband is away,” And while S’s decisions are none of my business, I can’t help but feel like she’s lying to me. I can’t help but assume that she told me not to text her because she’s with E and E will go through her texts. 

I’m just feeling crazy. I’m feeling sad and hurt and rejected. I think at this point I’m officially ghosted. I just want honesty. I don’t care if S doesn’t have feelings for me anymore but be forthright with it, you know? 

If you got this far into my post I applaud you... and I’d really appreciate any words of encouragement because I feel so dumb for being upset over this.",actuallesbians,1576875399,classicallyfem,,1,True,2019-12-20

7852,"Help, crushing so hard I'm turning into a zombie?!","TLDR: Can't eat or sleep due to infatuation. Slowly turning into a zombie. Any tips on how to stop this from happening?

I haven't had much of an appetite for months. I have to force myself to eat like 70% of the time. Sometimes, like after training, I actually do feel hungry. It also gets a bit better when I'm super distracted from something. Like when I spent a weekend at a cabin with my friends and boom, felt hungry and ate normally. I just didn't have any time to obsess over her, I guess.

Because of all of this, I have lost like 10-15 pounds this fall. Normally I love food and have absolutely no problems with my appetite. It all started when I realized I have feelings for this woman and it just got worse as my feelings grew stronger. I have never felt like this before, not even in my teens. Tbh I'm a bit scared of how intensive this feels.

I also have trouble sleeping, which is really unusual for me. I just can't fall asleep because I'm mentally replaying every freaking conversation and look between us, imagining my life with her in it or something similar.

What should I do? I mean, I've tried distracting myself with all sorts of activities but then I'm like ""yeah, this could be so much fun with her, wonder if she'd like this"" WHY AM I LIKE THIS?!",actuallesbians,1576877858,lilypad_padlily700,,1,True,2019-12-20

7854,Do many lesbians share those feelings or is it something else that I'm experiencing?,"Hello everyone. I'm really confused and need your help.

When I told my psychiatrist about some doubts I'm having and the things I've noticed about myself, he said those are normal and many lesbians share the same feelings:

(some of the things I mentioned to him like prefering male clothes/hairstyles, insisting on playing with boys' toys as a kid, hating girly things like makeup and skirts and dresses, hating my height/wanting to be taller, disliking my small hands and small shoulders, etc, yeah I agree these are normal and very common)

But idk about the rest of the things:

1- feelings of kinship with guys (like I belong with them) since I was in middle school unlike the girls who i always felt like they are ""the others""

2- feeling really happy when my guy friends call me their ""brother"" or ""one of them"" and not feeling the same when my female friends call me their ""sister"", also feeling happy when my parents describe how I was the influence on my brother since young age when it comes to being masculine and liking masculine stuff

3- (not really hating my chest per se cuz i simply ignore its presence most of the time as it's fairly small but) I do prefer if I had none, or sometimes I think if like I had breast cancer and it made me remove my breasts or something, as in I prefer them getting cut, and if i had some kind of excuse to get rid of them it'd be better

4- absolutely hating having ovaries and a uterus and I'd rather not think about them at all, and the possibility of being pregnant or something feels alienating and disgusting and makes me angry even

5- wishing I had a beard and imagining myself with a beard and wanting to grow a moustache and beard so badly and obsessed with looking into types of beard etc, and I've really really been obsessed with this for 4 years now

6- being excited about and obsessed with looking into male names (I already have a list of my favourite ones) since high school

7- feeling really uncomfortable when changing in the girl's changing room since young age and feeling self-conscious when in the girl's bathroom in the dorm, while I don't feel any sort of unease when around my semi-naked guy friends (in boxers and stuff) and when using their bathrooms at their houses (houses where like 3 guys live together)

Anyways, my psy says all those are common in many lesbians and they are due to my sexuality and just a form of fantasy that I have and possibly a simple desire to crossdress as a guy?

The worst thing is, after my psy told me basically ""you're not a trans guy"", that's all that's been on my mind, and it's making me feel like shit at the moment for some reason, instead of feeling relieved or something? Like I'm eeling way worse than before going to him. Like, being told I'm not a guy, like that, and the idea of not being a guy, is making me hate myself rn...

My question is, is it true that many lesbians really feel like this or is there something more to it and my psy is wrong?",actuallesbians,1576878165,Secritoo,,1,True,2019-12-20

7865,POC queer andro in LA realizing their preference...,"I’ve dated, mostly casually visited, gay women of myriad for the past few years—as well as men(I would say immature men, about 2 briefly) but only as my sexuality wanted to test ground... I have sought out a partner for life with each person I was interested in that showed interest back. So I was loyal to fault.

I’m very flexible between gender and sex and the mind.. I realized I was androgynous in 9th grade through debates with myself on feminine/masculine thought processes.... (I was a very intrepid student who didn’t do their honors homework, instead spent a lot of time building up social forums on, really, today’s casual rhetoric on sexuality.) Then I realized until this year that each year I was evolving my sexuality STILL at the age of 25. 

I also learned that being Mexican played a huge part in why I have viewed men and women in the ways that I have so far. There has been much machismo of course in our culture, and I know I adopted some masculine aggression to get through all sorts of people I’ve had a ‘thing’ with. 
People became very confused, and some females would think I was trying to be a man... 

I’ve been told I have gender dsyphoria by a special person last year and it was the final straw in me taking shit about my personality. lol

I have always been androgynous. I have always wanted a wife...recently I had run-ins with girls—a girl got me pregnant last year.. that made me realize what I don’t want and who I am not.
Because I got preggo(aborted!) I had stint thinking I could let a male get me pregnant and I would be cool with having a husband, but I realized I didn’t feel comfortable with my body like this. I tried dating men and talking to them, and also transwomen who haven’t transitioned—and I realize that while on social cues I am cool with all gender and sex, I still have a preference.

Admittedly, I am realizing I like white female lesbians and white queer androgynous females. I can’t seem to connect to many other POC in a romantic way. All of whom I have been with have been white/european roots..scav,italian, germ..

I feel like an alien sometimes. A queer andro dyke. It isn’t enough that I am who I am. It is difficult to find POC even in this liberal city who don’t resort to labeling my masculine nature as a ‘machismo’ from my culture. Like, I can’t explain this. Maybe I’m generalizing but my experiences have consistently been one-sidedly positive on a demographic in the dating world and they have mostly been with white lesbian women. Even though this one ‘true’ love I thought I had turned out be a terf, I blamed it on the Italian-Catholic upbringing... which to Mexicans is highly relatable of course. Otherwise, my interactions with people who are the most accepting and non-judgemental people have been white women.

I’m sorry if I offend anyone. I’m not surfing for LA dates either... I was houseless last year, I have been taking this year to look at my past life and get my virtues and morals together because I have been in the thick of fucked up millennial politics. Many of the types of people I mentioned in this post have helped me along these years. It’s an aspect of my life I’m pretty straightforward about.

I am bisexual and am definitely attracted to women. When I was younger, I did a lot of exploring with my sexuality and it was enjoyable.

I don’t know what it is but women really intimidate me. The more attracted to them I am, the more intimidated I am. I don’t know if it’s a weird inferiority complex thing or what but I can’t possibly imagine another girl enjoying being intimate with me, even though I know I’m pretty good looking (I’m the top earner at the strip club that I dance at).

7888,Fell in love at Harry Potter world and not sure how to proceed,"Hello! This is my first post on Reddit so I’m not sure if I’m doing this right—please let me know if this doesn’t belong here. I’m on vacation at Universal Studios, and I spent the most of today in the Wizarding World of Harry Potter. They had this frog choir performance in Hogsmeade, which I went to see. There were 4 performers and one of them was this STUNNING girl in Slytherin robes who absolutely took my breath away (her eyes were the same green as her robes and I damn near cried). It was a small crowd and I was right at the front and had no idea what to do with myself, just a complete mess. I’m not usually one to lose my head (at least noticeably) over a pretty girl, especially without knowing her at all, but my heart just flipped out watching her dance and sing and control this frog puppet. After the performance, the singers invited people to go up and talk to them/take pictures with them individually. I wanted to go up and talk to Slytherin girl and maybe get a photo, but I totally chickened out and missed my shot. A staff member announced that they would be performing tomorrow as well. So here’s the conundrum: I’m going back tomorrow to see the performance in full Gyffindor/HP gear, and part of me really wants to talk to this girl. I don’t know if it’s a good idea though because 1) I don’t want to be creepy, especially because I know people in the service industry get hit on a lot and I don’t want to make her uncomfortable 2) there’s a good chance she’s straight and 3) I don’t know if this whole interaction would be inappropriate because she’s a performer and I’m a guest. Maybe I’m wayyyy overthinking this, but I would love any thoughts/advice from any of y’all! My friends are telling me to shoot my shot, but I don’t want to royally mess this up.

She hasn’t come out or anything but her behavior just seems as if she is into me. I don’t want to write a long paragraph so I’m just going to put bullet points.

- She broke up with her boyfriend (of almost 3 years) right after we started getting close and talking again 
- She makes “jokes” about being gay or lesbian but often times they seem to serious to be a joke. She even once straight up told me “I’m lesbian” but immediately told me to just “forget it”
- She goes out of her way to talk to me. She walks with me everywhere even if it inconveniences her in the long run.
- She leans against me has held my hand before, puts her hand on my thigh, etc. She’s very touchy with me and no one else.
- She acts differently around me compared to her other friends. She’s more open and affectionate towards me and not with others.
- She even has joked about us dating or making out but they border on serious statements rather than jokes. 

I don’t know. Maybe I’m just crazy. I REALLY like her and I wish I could tell her my feelings but I’m on the fence. I’m really looking for anything at this point. Advice, help, answers.",actuallesbians,1576897371,emilymarieq,,1,True,2019-12-20
7891,How do I break it to my mom that she is not an honorary homosexual?,"So for context: I'm an NB lesbian and present masculinely or androgynously. My mom has always been supportive of both my sexuality and my gender presentation, which I'm very thankful for. For Christmas this year, she's buying me a custom suit! However, we got into a small argument today over just that, and it isn't the first time something like this has happened.

She told me to compile pictures of what I might like in a suit, and I told her that I'm not really sure what to be on the lookout for. She told me to look at pictures of Kristen Stewart (this alone was pretty funny IMO) because she's been, and I quote, ""very into suits lately.""

So naturally, I started giggling and cracked a joke about how ""very into suits lately"" is a funny way of saying a girl's gay. She took this personally, and got frustrated with me and said that I can't just laugh at her like she doesn't understand what ""Gay World"" is like.

I told her, of course, that she does *not* understand what Gay World is like, because she is not gay. This only made her more frustrated. She proceeded to explain that she has gay friends (oof) and asked me if I understood what ""Straight World"" is like. I said yes, because it's the world I was born and raised in. She then stormed out of the room in a huff.

How do I explain to my mother, that though I am very grateful for her continued support, she does not get honorary membership to Gay World?

I am 25 and have a very high libido but she just doesn't seem interested. 
I did a classic mistake of moving in with her when I was just 23 only after 6 months of our long distance relationship. I had a great job but I quit  just for living with her. I thought that I will first work in having a solid relationship and then move back to career. I didn't work for any corporate for the last two years and was dependent on her financially and used my own savings. Now, I have a job in hand but not so great. I know I can do better which means I will be financially independent quite soon. 
Initially, I thought that she is just tired because of hectic work schedule but later her work schedule became easier and we had a lot of time in hand but there was no significant improvement in our sex life. I am so unsatisfied,I just can't explain. I really love her but this lack of physical chemistry is driving me crazy. She says that she doesn't know why she is not interested and asks me to be more adjusting which I always try to be. If I don't ask her myself then she never initiates lovemaking. Even if we do start having sex she barely does much. She just lies on the bed and I feel like having sex with a stone. There is no passion coming from her end and I feel so helpless. She is a very caring person otherwise but this is not how I dreamt of my relationship. I have discussed this with her several times but she only asks for more time and less pressure to which I always agree. However, nothing has changed since two years. Now, she refuses to it lesser but there is no passion in her breath. It feels to me as if I am asking for favour. I just hate feeling like a beggar. I don't know what to do.

7921,HOLY SHIT. It's 3AM and I had a revelation that shook me to my fucking core. I think I might be nonbinary.,"(Warning: word vomit.)

Like, there was literally no foreshadowing for this. At least for the fact that I'm not straight, there was foreshadowing -I had several crushes that were suuuuper obvious in hindsight, I fantasized about women instead of men, I like yuri doujins, amongst other stuff.

But with this? There is literally no foreshadowing that I can think of from my childhood. I was very feminine as a child, very interested in ""girly"" stuff, and even had that obligatory ""all my clothes are from Justice"" phase. Like, all of this happened over the course of a year, and I only started questioning my gender a few months ago. (To be fair, since middle school my wardrobe has been gender-neutral, but still, that isn't necessarily a sign.) Like, I am so confused right now. I've had a few pieces of foreshadowing, like my fursona being big and muscular and the fact that I don't care about personal hygiene that much, but actually wanting to be a man but also a woman just came out of NOWHERE.

Last time I made a major change to my haircut, it became exceedingly masculine-looking in its natural messy state, with a touch of femininity. In the last month, my fashion sense has gone in two directions at once. Like, I just pierced my ears, and I want to wear jewelry and even perfume in the near-future, but I also started wearing plaid and questioned menswear before deciding that I like the idea. Like, all of these changes just feel right.

My body is an interesting mess. I want to keep my woman parts and most of my physique, but like, I also want to have a male voice and muscular arms (though that last part probably won't happen because I literally never exercise). Like, in the last three months, my mental voice has changed to that of a male, not sounding like my real voice at all, and it's so fucking dissonant having a female voice but having a male head-voice.

Oh, god, I'm shaking as I type this. I'm coming out in the morning, my family was supportive the first time and I know they'll be supportive the second time.

My female birth name suddenly feels foreign, wrong even. It just doesn't feel like me anymore. Like, I'm already considering changing my name to something more gender-neutral.

(I think I can thank Steven Universe the character for this. Like, he casually wears pink and has casually cross-dressed in multiple episodes. And when teenage Steven happened, my mental voice switched from Kid Steven to Teenage Steven, and I don't know how to finish this sentence because it's 3AM and I'm sleep deprived and thus my thoughts are a mess.)

By the way, my pronouns are now she/her and they/them.

None of the people who I have dated have had issues with my lesbian identity, but I can't help but feel kind of weird about it. I feel like by being a lesbian I might be invalidating their gender identities. 

I see a lot of stuff that supports ""women + non-men""  as a definition of lesbian. Do you guys agree with this definition, or is dating women + nb people an expression of bisexuality?",actuallesbians,1576919314,TreeRingsIn,,1,True,2019-12-21

7926,I Need lesbian relationship advice urgently. please help,"I am in a live-in relationship (almost like marriage) with a woman 11 yrs older to me. I am 25 and have a very high libido but she just doesn't seem interested. 
I did a classic mistake of moving in with her when I was just 23 only after 6 months of our long distance relationship. I had a great job but I quit  just for living with her. I thought that I will first work in having a solid relationship and then move back to career. I didn't work for any corporate for the last two years and was dependent on her financially and used my own savings. Now, I have a job in hand but not so great. I know I can do better which means I will be financially independent quite soon. 
Initially, I thought that she is just tired because of hectic work schedule but later her work schedule became easier and we had a lot of time in hand but there was no significant improvement in our sex life. I am so unsatisfied,I just can't explain. I really love her but this lack of physical chemistry is driving me crazy. She says that she doesn't know why she is not interested and asks me to be more adjusting which I always try to be. If I don't ask her myself then she never initiates lovemaking. Even if we do start having sex she barely does much. She just lies on the bed and I feel like having sex with a stone. There is no passion coming from her end and I feel so helpless. She is a very caring person otherwise but this is not how I dreamt of my relationship. I have discussed this with her several times but she only asks for more time and less pressure to which I always agree. However, nothing has changed since two years. Now, she refuses to it lesser but there is no passion in her breath. It feels to me as if I am asking for favour. I just hate feeling like a beggar. I don't know what to do.

7967,"How to tell my crush I like her, without breaking our actual relationship ?","Hello lesbians of reddit (and all the others 😊 ) ! I need some of your precious advices, but first, let’s dive into the context !

I (19 F) met this bisexual chick, Emma (21), at university and we kind of directly connected. But for the first weeks, we weren’t seeing each others that often, and were just heavily flirting whenever we did. That’s only after, around mid october that we began to see eachoters more often because we were attending the same partys thanks to common friends (one in particular who is her bestfriend and a great friend of mine, lets call her Chloe). During the first party, it just took us a few drinks to get really close, her body was telling me in every single way that she wanted me and we kissed. But we weren’t exclusive, and were still flirting and kissing other poeple even though it seemed that the sexual tension between her and I was much more intense than with the other poeple she was flirting with.

Two days later we had an other party where she got jealous because I kissed another girl, even though she did the same. I learnt the day after, that during that party she also got jealous with two other girls (let’s call one of them Anna) she was flirting with, for kind of the same reason. But that night we slept together and had sex. We both seemed to have enjoyed it and the next morning she left with a kiss for goodbye. 

We saw eachothers the day after, once again because of a party but she was acting really cold with me. I later learned that night, not from her but from one of her friends, that she was speaking again with her ex, with who she has been in a relationship for 3 years. And friends of that ex were there during the party. 

Because of her reaction, I took my distance for a few days and spoke with Chloe wondering why Emma was acting cold, but she didn’t know. It only took us another party to rebond, Emma apologized, telling me she didn’t mean to act this way. Later that night, we kissed. She came back home with me but each slept in her corner of the bed. We spoke for hours the next morning, still laying in bed while she finally told me about her ex and after a warm goodbye, she left.

Since then we slept togheter more than once (never had sex again though) and things are still ambiguous between us. I know for a fact that she’s physically attracted by me but that’s it. On mid november, she told me she had a crush on someone and that she completely stopped talking with her ex. But she for sure don’t want to tell me who is her crush. After some reflexion, the two only options are Anna… Or me. Because of her behavior I’m more than convinced that her crush is Anna (btw Anna is heterosexual and in a relationship with a man, but I know that Emma usually dates girls that are selfcalled heterosexuals), but I’ve still got a tiny mini doubt it might be me. (I know that because of the way I told the story, it might seem obvious I’m her crush, but in the reality it isn’t the case at all)

I can’t live with that doubt anymore that’s why **I wanna tell her I like her. But the problem is, wathever our actual relationship is, I don’t wanna lose it, and I’m scared that if it’s not reciprocal it might break it. Do you have any advice on the way I should tell her so that it stays easy-going ?**   
 Btw, I’ll probably have to do it by text because she came back home for the hollidays, and I probably won’t see her for one month or so, and I don’t know if I’ll be brave enough to tell it in front of her. Should I do it in person though ?

7986,My quest for finally some fucking good lesbian movies Part 1: Carol (2015) Review,"9/10

The movie has a great and captivating plot, and great characters. The couple, Carol and Therese are cute and have some genuinely sweet and romantic moments, unfortunately this movie is set in the past so it is difficult for them to be together, and there is also a particularly sad subplot going on. Nevertheless the acting is great, and so is the cinematography.",actuallesbians,1576965000,JackieNaper1907,,1,True,2019-12-21

I'm now her official roommate that's actually paying rent, her parents really like me which apparently never happens, and we just said I love you for the first time yesterday!

7993,Amicable Breakup Music?,"My girlfriend broke up with me Wednesday, and I've been trying to find music to accompany the tears. The thing is, we've been friends for many years, and we're not throwing that away. We may even get back together in a few years when we're in different places in our lives.

But most of the breakup music I've found is either ""I'm never going to see you again"" or ""fuck you, your loss"". I miss her, I wanted(still wish) to make it work. But we have game night tonight, with some other friends as well, and I'm not going to make this rough. We were only girlfriends for a few months, we've been friends for more years than that. I'm hurting, I want her to be more than friends and I can't have that much of her, but our friendship is still strong.

Anyone found songs to soothe and/or wallow after an amicable breakup?",actuallesbians,1576968490,Darekun,,1,True,2019-12-21
7994,Incredible connection with a “straight” girl,"Yesterday I went out clubbing with some friends and one of them had a friend visiting from another state. I found her cute but had not thought of initiating anything. I just liked her energy.

When she said she wanted to go to the restroom I said I wanted to go too and she held my hand tight as we walked through the crowd. We actually spent some time talking in the restroom about general stuff.

When I wanted to go to the restroom again she asked me if I wanted her to come with me so I said yes and here we are, she holds my hand again and we just stay in the bathroom talking. We go back, dance together with our friends and that’s it. As I got interested, I asked my friend what she knew about her and my friend told me she had a boyfriend. Yet, we kept on talking and dancing - I just enjoyed so much being near her and I couldn’t even think of hitting on anyone else. She just had my full attention. 

On our Uber ride to my friend’s place we sit side by side. We’re now all drunk and we hold each other hands while we caress our hands. 
And I tell her “I just want to make sure to tell you that I think you are so amazing and so pretty - I am fascinated”. Then she tells me that she really thinks we’re connected someone and that she’s never felt that way about anyone else. BUT that she was in a relationship and wasn’t sure about what to do.

I told her that I would be respectful of her and her relationship and that I still felt the same way. I kiss her on the cheek and all we can do is just to stare at each other like we’re just in our own world. 

Since we were four girls on the back of the car, she was kind of on my lap and I had my right arm around her. I just wanted to hold her close to me, I felt like she was the one - might have been the alcohol or the fact we also smoked a bit, who knows. And she’s reciprocating. We know we can’t kiss so we just caress each other’s hand in a way I never did with anyone else - as weird as it sounds it was like we were having sex just by holding hands. Yea a bit crazy. 

We all go home and chat a bit more and I go to sleep with my friend. Today I left and said goodbye. 

But she messaged me later today saying it was nice to meet me and I said the same. I don’t know if she feels different today but I still have feelings; it was just crazy how it all happened. 

My question being: What would you do if you felt truly connected with someone but they live in another state and have a boyfriend? 

I want to cultivate a friendship with her, but don’t know how to do it and feel nervous about it. Also, should I tell her to watch the L word? haha",actuallesbians,1576969034,cinnaq,,1,True,2019-12-21

7996,Dealing with shitty family for the holidays,How do you all cope? I’m forced to go hang out with my whole extended family that doesn’t know I’m gay and my mom is more embarrassed and secretive about me being gay than I am. She asked my niece to not talk about it around family because she doesn’t want to have to deal with it as if it’s her own secret and not mine. It just pisses me off so much. Most of them are homophobic so I’d get way more heat than she would.

7997,Advice on coming out to my parents ?,Hello I’m a 16 year old girl and I need some advice. I’m thinking about coming out to my parents. They aren’t homophobic and we aren’t religious. But I don’t know how they would feel if I came out to them. We’ve watched TV shows and movies with gay people in them and they seem to be okay with them. I’m not worried about my dad’s reaction because I know that he wouldn’t care at all. It’s my mom that I’m worried about. I told her I was bi when I was 13 and it didn’t go well. She told me it was a phase and that I’m too young to know what I want. We haven’t talked about since then. I’m tired of lying to them.
